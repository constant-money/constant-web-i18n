%%%.memberShip.faqs.2.question%%%,"Do outstanding loans and investments qualify for points?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.2.answer%%%,"          <p>          Yes. You can meet the minimum threshold for membership on active loans and investments that are yet to mature.          </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.3.question%%%,"Can I combine loans and investments to reach the membership threshold?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.3.answer%%%,"          <p>          No. The membership thresholds apply separately to loans and investments. For example, you must invest $25,000 or borrow $25,000 to qualify for Gold membership.          </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.4.question%%%,"How long do membership rewards last?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.4.answer%%%,"          <p>          The $50 cashback rewards and STAR bonus are <strong>one-off rewards only</strong>. The other benefits last as long as your points do. You earn a point for every dollar you invest or borrow and each point expires after 180 days. So, if you make a single investment of $25,000, for example, your points will last 180 days and so will the benefits.          </p>          <p>          If you invest several times to reach the minimum, your rewards will last 180 days from the first qualifying point you earned. For example, if you invest $10,000 and then $15,000 three months later, your benefits will continue until your first batch of points expire.           </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.5.question%%%,"Can I extend membership rewards?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.5.answer%%%,"          <p>          Yes! When your points expire, simply invest or borrow again to top them up. This way, you can keep your membership benefits for as long as you want them.           </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.6.question%%%,"Do I need to contact you when I’ve reached the minimum amount?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.6.answer%%%,"          <p>          No, you don’t need to do anything. We’ll track your investment and loan volume on a rolling six-month basis and when you meet the minimum threshold, we’ll immediately upgrade you to Gold, Platinum, or Diamond status.           </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.7.question%%%,"Why is there an expiration date on membership points?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.7.answer%%%,"          <p>          While there is an expiration date on points there is no expiration date on the Membership Rewards program. This is our way of saying thank you to our most loyal and active customers, so we want to run the program for as long as possible. The expiration date allows us to tie membership strictly to active, regular users of our platform.           </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.8.question%%%,"Can you qualify for each level multiple times?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.8.answer%%%,"          <p>          Yes, you can. However, the $150 and STAR bonuses can only be claimed once during the lifetime of your account. You can maintain the other benefits indefinitely.           </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.9.question%%%,"Can I earn all the benefits at once?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.9.answer%%%,"          <p>          Interest from referrals is exclusive to each level of membership. The instant credit reward can each be earned only one time per each level. For example, if you invest $100,000, you’ll get $150 + 1 STAR + 20% of earned interest from referred friends’ Flex accounts (until your membership points expire).           </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.10.question%%%,"How do I redeem STAR?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.10.answer%%%,"          <p>          By going to your <a href=""/accounts"" class=""underline bold"">Accounts</a> page you can redeem STAR against any active investment or loan. 1 STAR = +/- 1% interest (depending on if you’re a lender or borrower). The bonus or discount is applied from the date of redemption until the loan or investment matures. STAR tokens don’t expire, so you can save them up and redeem them in one go if you want.           </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.11.question%%%,"What happens when my points expire?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.11.answer%%%,"          <p>          You can top points up to maintain your membership benefits. Your Membership Rewards page shows when your points expire and you’ll also receive an email reminder from us too. If you allow your points to expire, you will lose your membership and benefits, but can always re-qualify by earning enough points. Please note the $150 and STAR bonuses are one-time benefits — you can only earn them once per level.           </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.12.question%%%,"Will my referral interest change when my points expire?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.12.answer%%%,"          <p>          As stated above, if you allow your points to expire, you will lose your membership and benefits. This includes bonus referral interest rates. However, all special interest rates from friends you refer will be upgraded upon achieving membership.           </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.13.question%%%,"Do I have to complete 3 Trustpilot reviews to get all $150?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.13.answer%%%,"          <p>          When you reach a new membership level you will be prompted to leave a review on our Trustpilot. Once you click the link to our Trustpilot on our membership page and enter your username your reward will be automatically credited to your account. If you have done this once you never have to do it again. Thanks for spreading the word about our platform :).           </p>          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.14.question%%%,"I am already a member. Can I claim an additional $50 or STAR reward for my current level?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.14.answer%%%,"          <p>          If you’re already participating in our membership program then, first of all, thank you! But since you’ve already received a reward for your current level, you must move up a level to receive new rewards.           </p>           <p>          <strong>For example:</strong> if you are already a Gold member you won’t be able to earn $50 cashback for Gold again but can gain $50 rewards if you upgrade to Platinum or Diamond. If you’re already a Diamond member you’ll be unable to receive further one-time rewards from any level as you already have earned them.           </p>           <p>          You will, however, be able to receive all extra interest and rewards on your new referrals based on your current level as well as its new withdrawal/deposit options.           </p>          "

I was very skeptical at first because it seemed too good to be true but in reality it is that great! Ultimately there is no fee to transfer money in or out, and it allows you to invest any amount of money for any rate that you would wish. Normally if I invest any sum of money for around 10% interest it is then matched to a borrower and I am able to earn the interest. If you go too high on the rate you don t lose anything but you also will not be matched to make money on your investment. It also lets you choose for how long to invest. Let me know if you have questions and I would be happy to explain more. My recommendation would be to set up an account and deposit a small amount to test it for yourself to get the hang of it.</p>                "

I like MyConstant approach to secured lending better and just moved more $ from my Worthy Bonds and Wealthfront accounts to MyConstant.

You can do one or a combination of the following:</p>          <ol>            <li>Transfer USD to one of our US bank accounts.</li>            <li>Send any one of our supported stablecoins: USDT/USDC/TUSD/GUSD/PAX/USDS.</li>            <li>Repay the equivalent USD value using your collateral.</li>          </ol>          <p>Your balance will update when funds have been received in your MyConstant account.</p>        "

%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer11%%%,"        <p>        Yes, after you take out a loan you can click on the Isolate button in the loan menu on your accounts page to switch to a single-collateral loan. To switch you must meet the 110% minimum collateral value requirement for the crypto. However, you cannot collateralize with more crypto than your collateral rate allows (more on that below).        </p>        "
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question12%%%,"Is repayment any different with multi-collateral credit lines?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer12%%%,"        <p>        Nope! You must still repay each loan individually. However, crypto selected for collateral repayments will still follow a 24-hour trading volume priority based on what you have available.        </p>        "
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question13%%%,"I can’t find where to choose multiple collaterals for my borrow order"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer13%%%,"        <p>        If you take out a crypto-backed loan or buy new cryptos using Crypto Credit, you’ll only see the option to use one collateral.

%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question14%%%,"Why do you prioritize collaterals based on 24-hour exchange volume?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer14%%%,"        <p>        Loan security is our top priority on MyConstant. In the unfortunate case of liquidation, we always want to make sure we can sell collateral as fast as possible to cover the loan value.        </p>        "

%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer16%%%,"        <p>        No. You can only toggle auto top-up on or off for all multi-collateral loans at the same time. However, you can choose this setting separately for each isolated (single-collateral) loan.        </p>        "

%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question19%%%,"If I have multiple active loans, which collaterals do I get back when I repay my earliest loans?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer19%%%,"        <p>        If you still have active loans after repaying, your collateral won’t be released back to your available balance. Instead, it will go into your collateral balance for multi-collateral. If you want to remove collateral from this balance, you’ll need to recall excess from the overview screen and choose the crypto type and amount you want.        </p>        "
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question20%%%,"I can’t recall excess on my crypto even though my collateral value is over 110%."
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer20%%%,"        <p>        Collateral value is only used to determine loan liquidation. It is calculated by:        </p>        <p class=""font-italic"">        (number of coins * value)+”repeat for each coin”/(loan value + up-to-date interest + matching fee)        </p>        <p>        We calculate how much collateral you withdraw through recall excess based on the collateral rate. For more information on the collateral rate see below.        </p>        "
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question21%%%,"What is the collateral rate and why is it different from the collateral value?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer21%%%,"        <p>        Collateral value only takes into account the monetary value of your collateral in your collateral balance compared to your loan amount. We base liquidation off collateral value. Your collateral rate is a more in-depth number that takes into account the LTV ratios required for different cryptocurrencies. We use this number to determine how much you can withdraw with recall excess as well as the maximum amount of crypto you can place in an Isolated loan.        </p>        <p>        You can find your collateral rate through this equation:        </p>        <p class=""font-italic"">        x = (number of coins)*(coin value)*(LTV)+“repeat for each coin”<br />        Collateral rate = (x/(loan value at first + up-to-date interest + matching fees))*100        </p>        "

          <p class=""text-left"">The global banking system is imperfect, and some banks lack the direct relationships that support international wire transfers. These banks may depend on one or more intermediary banks (banks in addition to yours and ours) to help process the wire.</p>  
          <p class=""text-left"">Intermediary banks may automatically deduct fees for this service before the wire reaches your bank (withdrawal) or our bank (deposit). Unfortunately, these fees are outside of our control, and we can’t reliably inform you of the intermediary banks involved nor their fees in advance.</p> 
          <p class=""text-left"">While we don’t charge a USD withdrawal fee, you might still receive less than the withdrawal amount (after deducting your bank’s wire receipt fee) due to intermediary bank fees. Similarly, you might receive less in your MyConstant account after a deposit due to the same intermediary bank fees.</p>

A Loan Originator investment is a claim against a loan issued by our loan originator partner. Instead of buying the loan with all the rights and ownership of collateral (if any), you’re buying a right to receive payments from an existing loan. </p>        <p>When you invest in a Loan Originator, the loan originator will guarantee to buy back the loan if the borrower defaults for 60 days.

%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question2%%%,"How do Loan Originator loans work?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer2%%%,"When you invest in a Loan Originator loan, you’re lending to a borrower through one of our loan origination partners. Depending on the loan originator, you might receive monthly repayments of the total due, monthly payments of the interest only, or everything at the end of the term – all of which you can withdraw when paid. If the borrower is 60 days late on any of these repayments, the loan originator will buy back the loan and return your principal and earned profit."
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question3%%%,"What is a loan originator?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer3%%%,"A loan originator is a partner that sources borrowers on our behalf. Some arrange loans for borrowers with collateral – such as cars or property – while others assess borrowers’ credit before issuing loans. In either case, our loan originators all come with a buy-back guarantee.

If borrowers default for a minimum of 60 days, the loan originator will buy back the loan. This returns your principal and earned profit up to and including the 60-day default period.</p> <p>A crypto-backed loan is secured by collateral. If borrowers default or their collateral falls too much in value, we sell it to repay you.

%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer7%%%,"        <p>First, you have the loan originator’s buy-back guarantee. If borrowers default for 60 days, the loan originator will buy back the loan to return your principal and earned profit up to and including the 60-day period. However, since you rely on the loan originator’s ability to buy back the loan, we’ve given each of them a rating.</p> <p>The MyConstant Rating is based on the loan originator’s business and performance, including the default rate, their stake in each loan, and types of loan offered. You can use the MyConstant Rating to choose between loan originators, but please remember it is just a guide.

%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question8%%%,"Does the buy-back guarantee protect me in all cases?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer8%%%,"        <p>In most cases, but not all. Since the loan originator buys back the loan, it depends on their ability to do so, and that’s why we give them a MyConstant rating from A to D, A being the best. Most of the loans we offer will be C or above. </p>        <p>Also, certain countries allow borrowers to request extensions on loans. In this case, an extension isn’t considered a default, so you might wait a bit longer for your returns. If the borrower still hasn’t repaid in full by the end of the extension, the loan originator will buy back the loan as usual. </p>        "
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question9%%%,"What happens if a loan originator doesn’t honor the buy-back guarantee?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer9%%%,"We don’t expect this to happen, but if it does, there are several options available to us. If they can’t honor the buy-back guarantee due to financial issues, we may negotiate a repayment plan with the loan originator and repay you in full or periodically as they repay. Otherwise, you or us may wish to pursue legal action against the loan originator.

%%%.deposit.faqs.0.question%%%,"What is Flex?"
%%%.deposit.faqs.0.answer%%%,"      <p>Flex is a deposit account that earns you 4% APY through automatic lending. When you deposit money into Flex, it goes into a liquidity pool managed by Compound Finance. Borrowers who’ve put up collateral can then secure loans from the pool in return for interest – and we pay that interest to you. Since your deposits go to a pool rather than individual borrowers, you can withdraw or deposit anytime, as often as you like, and without any fees.</p>      <p><a href=""https://blog.myconstant.com/flex-apy-account-compound-finance"" class=""underline"" target=""_blank"">How Flex works.</a></p>      "
%%%.deposit.faqs.1.question%%%,"Why 4% APY?"
%%%.deposit.faqs.1.answer%%%,"Compound Finance uses a blockchain protocol that intelligently manages the lending pool. It also sets interest rates according to supply and demand. At the moment, the rate is fixed at 4% APY. In the future, it could be higher or lower depending on activity in Compound’s lending market."
%%%.deposit.faqs.2.question%%%,"What is Compound Finance?"
%%%.deposit.faqs.2.answer%%%,"      <p>Compound Finance is a technology that intelligently manages a lending pool of over $150 million in assets (as of September 2019). Flex interfaces with this technology through an API that allows you to withdraw your deposits and earned interest at any time.</p>      <p>Compound Finance lends in a similar way to banks: your deposits go in and are lent to borrowers in exchange for interest and collateral. But since Compound Finance is a technology, there is no need for branches or staff, so you enjoy a much better interest rate!</p>      <p><a href=""https://compound.finance/"" class=""underline"" target=""_blank"">Learn more about Compound Finance.</a></p>      "

%%%.deposit.faqs.4.question%%%,"Can I withdraw anytime?"
%%%.deposit.faqs.4.answer%%%,"Yes. Since you’re not lending your deposits to an individual, but to a lending pool, you can deposit or withdraw as much and as often as you like."
%%%.deposit.faqs.5.question%%%,"How do my deposits earn interest?"
%%%.deposit.faqs.5.answer%%%,"Flex uses an API with Compound Finance to lend your deposits to a liquidity pool. Others borrow from the pool in return for putting up collateral, and you earn the interest. In other words, Flex is very similar to how investments work on MyConstant, only with Flex you can withdraw anytime."
%%%.deposit.faqs.6.question%%%,"Are my deposits insured?"
%%%.deposit.faqs.6.answer%%%,"      <p>Not always, no. While held with our trust partner, Prime Trust, your deposits are covered by a $130,000,000 insurance policy. However, we expect deposits will spend most of their time earning interest through Compound Finance, so will instead be protected by collateral put up by Compound's users.</p>      <p><a href=""https://blog.myconstant.com/flex-or-prime-trust-constant"" class=""underline"" target=""_blank"">Earn interest on your deposits or insure them?</a></p>      "
%%%.deposit.faqs.7.question%%%,"Can I deposit collateral or other cryptocurrency into Flex?"
%%%.deposit.faqs.7.answer%%%,"At the moment, Flex only accepts USD and USD-backed stablecoins."
%%%.deposit.faqs.8.question%%%,"Can I earn interest while waiting for an investment order to match?"
%%%.deposit.faqs.8.answer%%%,"No, your funds are set aside while waiting for a match so won't earn interest on Flex. If you decide to cancel the order, your funds will return to earning interest in Flex."
%%%.deposit.faqs.9.question%%%,"Will the interest rate change?"
%%%.deposit.faqs.9.answer%%%,"The interest rate depends on supply and demand in Compound's lending market. Sometimes it's higher, sometimes it's lower, but for the time being we've fixed this at 4% APY."
%%%.deposit.faqs.10.question%%%,"Are there any fees?"
%%%.deposit.faqs.10.answer%%%,"No – all deposits and withdrawals on Flex are free."
%%%.deposit.faqs.11.question%%%,"How does MyConstant make money?"

%%%.depositFiat.faqs.8.question%%%,"Why do you limit Zelle deposits?"
%%%.depositFiat.faqs.8.answer%%%,"
          <p>Our custodial partner, Prime Trust, doesn’t currently support Zelle transfers. Until now, we’ve accepted these deposits and then transferred them to Prime Trust on your behalf. However, this is both inefficient and means you have to entrust us with your money.</p>
          <p>Our aim has always to be a non-custodial platform, and as a result, we’re phasing out Zelle so Prime Trust manages all cashflow on our behalf. You have the option of Zelle deposits during this transitionary period as we know it’s convenient for you, but limited to under $2,000 per transaction.</p>
        "
%%%.depositFiat.faqs.9.question%%%,"Why can’t I send an ACH from outside the US?"
%%%.depositFiat.faqs.9.answer%%%,"
          <p>Our custodial partner, Prime Trust, accepts ACH through Plaid, an ACH processor. At the moment, you can only link US bank accounts through Plaid. If you bank outside of the US, please send a wire instead.</p>

%%%.depositFiat.faqs.10.question%%%,"What are Instant Credits?"
%%%.depositFiat.faqs.10.answer%%%,"
          <p>Instant Credits is a program we developed to pay you interest on ACH deposits while they’re being processed. ACH transfers can take up to 5 business days and your funds wouldn’t normally earn interest during this time. But with Instant Credits, you earn 4% APY from the moment you create the ACH transfer.</p>
          <p>Until your ACH has finished processing, you won’t be able to withdraw or invest your deposit in a crypto-backed or Loan Originator loan. Instant Credits transaction limits are calculated using the formula below:</p>
          <p class=""font-italic"">Your Instant Credit Limit = Your current balance + $1,000 (max $25,000 per transaction)</p>
          <p>For example, if your balance is $5,000, your Instant Credit limit is $6,000. This means you’ll earn 4% APY on a transaction of up to $6,000 while your ACH is processed.</p>

%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.1.question%%%,"What is the ${kYCTrialAmount} trial bonus?"
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.1.answer%%%,"
            <p>The ${kYCTrialAmount} trial bonus is a way to experience investing on our platform without committing any of your own money. Instead, we credit your Flex account with a ${kYCTrialAmount} bonus that you can watch grow at 4% APY, compounded and paid every second. Then, at the end of 30 days, we take back the ${kYCTrialAmount} and you keep the interest, which you can then reinvest with some of your own money or withdraw to your bank account.</p>
            "
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.2.question%%%,"Why are you offering this bonus?"
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.2.answer%%%,"
            <p>We understand that investing can be a little daunting at first – especially if you’ve never done it before. The bonus therefore gives you a taste for investing with us and will hopefully inspire you to continue investing with us for even bigger returns.</p>
            "
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.3.question%%%,"How do I get the bonus?"
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.3.answer%%%,"
            <p>To qualify for the bonus, you must be a US citizen. Then, you simply sign up for a free MyConstant account, verify your ID (KYC), and your ${kYCTrialAmount} bonus will be paid into your account immediately. You won’t be able to withdraw the bonus, and it’ll be debited from your account after 30 days, but you keep all the interest.</p>
            "
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.4.question%%%,"How do I verify my ID?"
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.4.answer%%%,"
            <p>We have to verify your ID to comply with US Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve created an account, you’ll be asked to submit address and ID proof, so we can verify your ID and approve your account.</p>
            <p>KYC verification is usually very fast, assuming you submit all relevant details and they’re clear, legible, and valid.</p>
            <p>Here’s a tip sheet: <a href=""https://blog.myconstant.com/how-to-verify-your-id-on-constant-kyc/"" class=""underline"" target=""_blank"">How to verify your ID on MyConstant</a>.</p>

%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.5.question%%%,"Can I withdraw the ${kYCTrialAmount}?"
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.5.answer%%%,"
            <p>No, the ${kYCTrialAmount} is locked into your Flex account for the 30 days. After 30 days, we take back the ${kYCTrialAmount} but you keep the interest.</p>
            "
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.6.question%%%,"What happens after the trial?"
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.6.answer%%%,"
               <p>Once we’ve taken back the ${kYCTrialAmount}, you keep the interest. It’s up to you what you’d like to do next. You can keep your interest in Flex earning 4% APY with anytime free withdrawals, or you can add some of your own money and reinvest in a crypto-backed loan for {rate}% APR (minimum investment is $50). You can also just withdraw it to your bank account. The choice is yours!</p>
               <p>
                <strong>Important note:</strong> You must deposit, withdraw, or invest within 90 days of receiving your free interest otherwise it will expire.

            "
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.7.question%%%,"How do I withdraw my interest?"
%%%.landingPage.faqs.data.7.answer%%%,"
            <p>After the 30 days is up, you can withdraw the interest on the ${kYCTrialAmount} bonus. To do so, head to your Accounts page and click Withdraw to fiat. You can only withdraw in fiat and not in a digital currency such as a stablecoin.</p>
