%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question21%%%,"What is the collateral rate and why is it different from the collateral value?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer21%%%,"
        <p>
        Collateral value only takes into account the monetary value of your collateral in your collateral balance compared to your loan amount. We base liquidation off collateral value. Your collateral rate is a more in-depth number that takes into account the LTV ratios required for different cryptocurrencies. We use this number to determine how much you can withdraw with recall excess as well as the maximum amount of crypto you can place in an Isolated loan.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can find your collateral rate through this equation:
        </p>

        x = (number of coins)*(coin value)*(LTV)+“repeat for each coin”<br />

%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question1%%%,"What is Crypto Credit?"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer1%%%,"
        <p>Crypto Credit is a fast, easy way to borrow USD against your existing cryptocurrencies to buy new coins.It’s a bit like a margin account, only it’s faster, cheaper, and you always get the best price for your chosen cryptocurrency.</p> 
        <p>You choose the interest rate and term and put down collateral equivalent to the USD value of your chosen crypto. We then search multiple exchanges to find the best prices and then deposit your chosen crypto into your Constant coin balance.</p> 
        <p>Meanwhile, we store your collateral in a Prime Trust wallet insured to $100M. When you repay the USD loan, you get your collateral back. There are no trading fees, no withdrawal fees, and you always get the best price for your chosen cryptocurrency.</p>"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question2%%%,"How does Crypto Credit work?"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer2%%%,"
        <p>First, decide which cryptocurrency you want to buy. </p>
        <p>Then, set the details for your loan – including the collateral you want to use, the interest rate, and term.</p> 
        <p>You’ll then see how much USD you’re going to borrow. This is also the amount you’ll need to repay. We get prices from multiple exchanges to ensure you get the best deal.</p> 
        <p>If you have enough collateral in your coin balance, you can create your order. Otherwise you’ll need to top-up from your coin balance first. You won’t be able to create an order unless you have sufficient collateral in your coin balance.</p> 
        <p>When you match with an investor, we use their funds to buy your chosen cryptocurrency and then deposit it in your coin balance. You can then withdraw it to any wallet you like. You won’t interact with an exchange at all. </p>
        <p>Then, just repay before the term ends to get your collateral back.</p> 
        <p>That’s it!</p>
        "
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question3%%%,"Why use Crypto Credit instead of an exchange?"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer3%%%,"
        <p>Exchange margin accounts charge higher interest rates, trading fees, withdrawal fees, and have only one source for pricing data: the exchange. </p>
        <p>With Constant Crypto Credit, you set the rate and term to a level you’re comfortable with. Then, we search multiple exchanges to find you the best price, and faster, so you don’t ever miss out on better deals. All trading and withdrawals are free, too.</p> 
        <p>While with us, your collateral is held in a Prime Trust wallet insured to $100M. Most exchanges store collateral in uninsured hot wallets which are less secure and don’t cover you against theft.</p>

%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question4%%%,"Am I borrowing cryptocurrency or USD?"

        You borrow USD that we then use to buy your chosen cryptocurrency for you. We do the hard work on the exchanges so you can focus on your trading strategy.

%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer5%%%,"
          <p>You can repay your loan in the following ways:</p>
            <p>1) Deposit USD or a supported stablecoin. <br/>
            2) Repay the equivalent USD value using your collateral.</p> 
        "
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question6%%%,"How do you protect my collateral?"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer6%%%,"
          <p>Your collateral is stored in a Prime Trust wallet that’s insured to $100,000,000. This protects you against:</p>
            <p> - Third-party hacks, copying, or theft of private keys.<br>
             - Insider theft of dishonest acts by BitGo employees or executives.<br>
             - Loss of keys.</p>
          <p>When you repay, we co-sign the release of your collateral back into your coin balance and you can then withdraw it to any wallet address you choose.</p>

%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question7%%%,"How long will it take to match and get my cryptocurrency?"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer7%%%,"
        This depends on the rates and terms you set. Market rates will match you in thirty minutes, and you’ll match even faster if you set a higher rate. As we know timely settlement is important for margin traders, it might be worth paying more for a fast match. 
        "
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question8%%%,"Do you check my credit score?"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer8%%%,"
          As we only offer secured loans backed by collateral, there is no need for credit scoring. All you need is adequate collateral to secure your loan. When creating your loan order, you’ll see how much collateral you need. 
        "
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question9%%%,"What happens if I don’t repay the loan?"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer9%%%,"
          If you don’t repay the loan, your collateral will be sold to repay your investor. You get to keep your chosen cryptocurrency. That’s it.
        "
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question10%%%,"What happens if my crypto collateral falls in value?"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer10%%%,"
        <p>We will notify you three times at 5% intervals before your collateral falls to 110% of the loan value + interest to date. At that point, we’ll create a sell order to repay the investor. You keep your chosen cryptocurrency, but lose your collateral. </p>
        <p>You receive email notifications at 125%, 120% and 115% of the investor’s principal plus earned interest. You can choose to repay early to avoid liquidation or top up more collateral. In the event of a flash crash, collateral will be automatically liquidated at 110%.</p>

%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer11%%%,"
        <p>If you'd like to pay back your loan before 75% of the term is up, that's absolutely fine. You simply have to pay interest for the days you are in possession of the loan, and just 50% of the original interest rate for the remaining days of the term.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to pay back your loan after 75% of the term is up and claim back your collateral, that's also fine, but the interest due on that loan is the full percentage for the entire term.</p>

%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question13%%%,"What is the LTV (Loan-to-Value) Ratio? Is it always the same?"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer13%%%,"
        The LTV ratio varies according to the trading activity and liquidity of your chosen collateral. Most supported collateral has an LTV ratio of 66% for 9-month loans or shorter. That means we require 150% of the loan value in collateral. If you’re borrowing against stablecoins, the LTV ratio is 100% (you must put up 100% of the loan amount in stablecoins to obtain a loan).
        "
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.question14%%%,"What happens if I repay late?"
%%%.home.constantC2CLoan.faqs.answer14%%%,"
        The grace period for receiving payment is 3 days after your term ends. On the 2nd and 3rd day, you will incur a late fee of 10% of the total interest due.

This is usually very fast – around 1 block confirmation – but might take a little longer during busy times. When your status changes, it means we’ve begun finding an investor to accept your terms. We’ll email you as soon as we find you a match.

%%%.faqs.value.question1%%%,"Will the price of Constant go “to the moon”?"
%%%.faqs.value.answer1%%%,"
        <p>Constant is a stablecoin designed to always match the value of USD. However, we can’t control the market, nor the effect of supply and demand, so you never know what price Constant will be. In some cases, people will pay more for stability. All we can guarantee is that you can always buy or redeem Constant from us for $1.</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.value.question2%%%,"Why is Constant’s price different on exchanges?"
%%%.faqs.value.answer2%%%,"
        <p>Exchanges connect buyers and sellers, and the price of an asset is determined by the forces of supply and demand – the price people are willing to pay based on the asset’s perceived value. The more there is of an asset, the cheaper it is (usually), and vice versa.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Since Constant is a stablecoin pegged to the USD, you might be surprised to see its price higher or lower on exchanges. This is outside of our control, and entirely set by the market. Some people will pay a premium for stability, for example.</p>

%%%.faqs.tech.question1%%%,"Why do you digitize my investment?"
%%%.faqs.tech.answer1%%%,"
        <p>When you invest money for the long term, some local currencies can lose value due to inflation. This eats into your investment income, diminishing your returns. We don’t think that’s fair. So instead, we convert your principal into a “digital dollar” that’s 100% backed by real USD – the world’s reserve currency.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Our digital dollar is called Constant. Anytime you invest or withdraw, we create or destroy Constant to ensure it’s 1:1 backed, always matching the value of USD. That way, you never need worry about inflation and other economic pressures eating into your investment. You just sit back and watch your money grow.</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.tech.question2%%%,"How does digitization work?"
%%%.faqs.tech.answer2%%%,"
        <p>First, we send your investment principal to the Constant Vault for safekeeping. Then, we create new Constant tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that match the USD value of your principal. For example, if you gave us the equivalent of $100 in your local currency, we send $100 to the Constant Vault and create 100 Constant.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Constant remains in your account for your commitment period, earning investment income that you can save or withdraw daily. Then, when your period ends, you can withdraw your principal from the Constant Vault (and any returns) and we’ll destroy the Constant. Or, if you’d rather use the Constant tokens to send money abroad, trade on exchanges, or reinvest for another period, please do!</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.withdraw.question1%%%,"How do I withdraw Constant?"
%%%.faqs.withdraw.answer1%%%,"
        <p>Constant works with your local banking system so you can withdraw in USD or local currency. Although we store your deposits as USD, they’ll be automatically converted back into your local currency (at the real-time market rate) if you withdraw to a non-USD bank account.</p>
        <br />
        <p>To withdraw funds, simply request the amount you’d like to withdraw from the Withdraw tab, enter the bank details, and click Withdraw. Alternatively, you can also withdraw funds as Constant, our USD-backed stablecoin, to an ETH or EOS wallet. Just enter the wallet address and click Withdraw.</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.withdraw.question2%%%,"In which currencies can I withdraw?"

        <p>Of course, you don’t have to withdraw to a bank account at all. You can withdraw your money as Constant, our USD-backed stablecoin, to an ETH or EOS wallet and then trade it for other currency pairs on supported exchanges.</p>

%%%.newHome.faqs.question1%%%,"What is peer-to-peer (P2P) lending?"
%%%.newHome.faqs.answer1%%%,"
      <p>P2P lending is where one person lends to another in return for interest, without any third party getting in the way. Unlike bank lending, where the bank lends your deposits and keeps the lion’s share of interest, P2P lending lets you keep all the profits yourself.</p>
      <p>On our platform, you also set your own rates and terms, which gives you plenty of flexibility to find the right investment. We also differ from other P2P lending platforms in that we only use liquid collateral – in other words, we secure loans with collateral that’s easy to sell if borrowers default, ensuring you get your money back (plus interest).</p>
      <p>New to P2P lending? <a href=""https://www.myconstant.com/blog/peer-to-peer-lending-what-you-should-know-before-investing"" class=""underline"" target=""_blank"">Here’s what to know before you invest.</a></p>
      "
%%%.newHome.faqs.question2%%%,"What makes Constant different from other P2P lending platforms?"
%%%.newHome.faqs.answer2%%%,"
        <p>Constant is a fully-secured peer-to-peer lending platform. Every loan is backed by collateral of up to 150% of the loan amount, which is sold if borrowers default or its value falls to a threshold, protecting investors (borrowers keep the loan).</p>
        <p>Unlike other platforms, Constant pools investor funds into a lending pool or reserve. This means you match instantly, whether you’re a borrower or an investor. We don’t need credit checks and we offer three fixed-term investments to give you flexibility.</p>
        <p>As well as providing you with a platform on which to do business, we also believe in giving you the educational resources to reach your financial goals, fast. To learn more, <a href=""https://myconstant.com/blog"" class=""underline"" target=""_blank"">check out our blog</a>.</p>

%%%.newHome.faqs.answer4%%%,"
        <p>All loans are up to 150% backed by collateral put up by borrowers. If borrowers default or their collateral falls too much in value, the collateral is sold to repay investors.</p>
        <p>In addition, we use qualified custodial partners (Prime Trust) to manage both fiat (USD) and digital assets. This additional layer of protection helps minimize the threat of theft, mismanagement, or loss of your assets.</p>

People are trapped in centralized systems designed to profit a select few. Money sits languishing in even the best bank accounts, steadily losing value as inflation rises.

        <p>We’ve taken important steps to safeguard not just your investment, but your returns, too:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>All of our borrowers must put up 150% of the loan amount as crypto collateral (100% if stablecoins to reflect their stability). If they don’t repay, we sell the collateral to repay you.</li>
          <li>We also include a liquidation threshold to insure against a fall in the collateral’s value. If the value falls to 110% of your principal and earned interest (100% if a stablecoin), it’s sold to repay you.</li>
          <li>We only accept vetted, quality cryptocurrencies and cap our exposure to these markets by daily trading volume. This ensures we can sell the collateral should the market dip.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These protective measures help ensure you get the returns promised. However, all investment involves risk, and despite our best efforts, we can’t guarantee the return of your principal and profit. Therefore please invest wisely.</p>

        <p>When not on loan or waiting for a match, your money earns 4% APY through Flex – an anytime-withdrawal account powered by Compound Finance. Secured, flexible, and automatic, Flex is an easy way to keep growing your money between investments. All withdrawals are free and unlimited.</p>
        <p>If you're waiting for a match, your money remains in the custody of Prime Trust, an accredited US financial institution that insures deposits up to $130M.</p>
        <p>Flex is enabled by default, but you can disable it from your Accounts page. You will no longer earn interest and your funds will remain in Prime Trust custody (unless you invest in a fixed-term loan).</p>

%%%.home1.faqs.question6%%%,"What happens if a borrower repays early?"
%%%.home1.faqs.answer6%%%,"
        <p>If a borrower repays before 75% of the loan term is complete, they’ll pay you earned interest to date plus 50% of the interest due on the remainder of the term.</p>
        <p>If a borrower repays after 75% of the loan term is complete, they’ll pay you 100% of the interest due on the loan.</p>

%%%.home1.faqs.question7%%%,"What happens if you have to sell borrower collateral to repay me?"
%%%.home1.faqs.answer7%%%,"
        <p>If a borrower can’t repay, or their collateral falls to 110% of your principal and earned profit, we’ll sell the collateral to repay you. In either case, you’ll get your principal back. You’ll also get earned interest to date if the collateral is sold mid-term, or 100% of the interest due if the collateral is sold after the term ends.</p>
      "
%%%.home1.faqs.question8%%%,"Can I end my investment term early?"
%%%.home1.faqs.answer8%%%,"
        <p>Yes. To end your term early, you can sell your investment to another investor from your Accounts page. Once sold, you’ll get your principal back and 2% APR on elapsed term time. Selling relies on finding a buyer willing to accept your rate and term so might take around 24 hours. You’ll also lose any earned membership points on your sold investment.</p>

%%%.home1.faqs.question9%%%,"How long until I start earning interest?"
%%%.home1.faqs.answer9%%%,"
        <p>Your investments join a lending reserve from which borrowers can get loans. This means you start earning interest the moment we receive your funds.</p>

%%%.deposit1.faqs.question1%%%,"What is Flex?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer1%%%,"
      <p>Flex is a deposit account that earns you 4% APY through automatic lending. When you deposit money into Flex, it goes into a liquidity pool managed by Compound Finance. Borrowers who’ve put up collateral can then secure loans from the pool in return for interest – and we pay that interest to you. Since your deposits go to a pool rather than individual borrowers, you can withdraw or deposit anytime, as often as you like, and without any fees.</p>
      <p><a href=""https://www.myconstant.com/blog/flex-apy-account-compound-finance"" class=""underline"" target=""_blank"">How Flex works.</a></p>
      "
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question2%%%,"Why 4% APY?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer2%%%,"Compound Finance uses a blockchain protocol that intelligently manages the lending pool. It also sets interest rates according to supply and demand. At the moment, the rate is fixed at 4% APY. In the future, it could be higher or lower depending on activity in Compound’s lending market."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question3%%%,"What is Compound Finance?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer3%%%,"
      <p>Compound Finance is a technology that intelligently manages a lending pool of over $150 million in assets (as of September 2019). Flex interfaces with this technology through an API that allows you to withdraw your deposits and earned interest at any time.</p>
      <p>Compound Finance lends in a similar way to banks: your deposits go in and are lent to borrowers in exchange for interest and collateral. But since Compound Finance is a technology, there is no need for branches or staff, so you enjoy a much better interest rate!</p>

      "
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question4%%%,"Do you have a referral program for Flex?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer4%%%,"Yes, we do. For every friend you refer to Flex, you’ll get 10% of their interest earnings for the first year (up to a maximum of $1,000,000). For more details, <a href=""/referral"">visit your Referrals page.</a>"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question5%%%,"Can I withdraw anytime?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer5%%%,"Yes. Since you’re not lending your deposits to an individual, but to a lending pool, you can deposit or withdraw as much and as often as you like."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question6%%%,"How do my deposits earn interest?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer6%%%,"Flex uses an API with Compound Finance to lend your deposits to a liquidity pool. Others borrow from the pool in return for putting up collateral, and you earn the interest. In other words, Flex is very similar to how investments work on Constant, only with Flex you can withdraw anytime."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question7%%%,"Are my deposits insured?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer7%%%,"
      <p>Not always, no. While held with our trust partner, Prime Trust, your deposits are covered by a $130,000,000 insurance policy. However, we expect deposits will spend most of their time earning interest through Compound Finance, so will instead be protected by collateral put up by Compound's users.</p>

%%%.deposit1.faqs.question8%%%,"Can I deposit collateral or other cryptocurrency into Flex?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer8%%%,"At the moment, Flex only accepts USD and USD-backed stablecoins."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question9%%%,"Can I earn interest while waiting for an investment order to match?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer9%%%,"No, your funds are set aside while waiting for a match so won't earn interest on Flex. If you decide to cancel the order, your funds will return to earning interest in Flex."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question10%%%,"Will the interest rate change?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer10%%%,"The interest rate depends on supply and demand in Compound's lending market. Sometimes it's higher, sometimes it's lower, but for the time being we've fixed this at 4% APY."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question11%%%,"Are there any fees?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer11%%%,"No – all deposits and withdrawals on Flex are free."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question12%%%,"How does Constant make money?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer12%%%,"Flex deposits earn interest through an API with Compound Finance, another lending platform. Compound sets interest rates according to supply and demand, and Constant will make a slim profit on any difference between the Flex and Compound rates."

%%%.staking.learnMoreFAQs%%%,"check out our FAQs."
%%%.staking.faqs.1.question%%%,"What is a masternode?"
%%%.staking.faqs.1.answer%%%,"A masternode is a member of a blockchain network that stores an entire copy of the blockchain on their computer at all times. They’re vital to maintaining and securing a blockchain network. To qualify as a masternode, you must first stake a large amount of a blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, which incentivizes the right behavior and discourages fraud. In return for helping maintain the network, masternodes receive a cryptocurrency reward."
%%%.staking.faqs.2.question%%%,"What is a masternode pool?"
%%%.staking.faqs.2.answer%%%,"Rather than one person staking the minimum amount to become a masternode, a masternode pool crowdsources the cryptocurrency from multiple people on the network. This makes it easier to become a masternode for people without the minimum stake, and distributes the rewards among a greater number of people. As a masternode pool further decentralizes a network, it could also be argued it is more secure and democratic."
%%%.staking.faqs.3.question%%%,"Will the staking rewards ever change?"
%%%.staking.faqs.3.answer%%%,"The interest you earn for staking in the masternode pool depends on the blockchain. It’ll be fixed for the beginning of your staking term, but might change during your term or the next time you stake. We’ll make it clear just how much you’ll earn through our masternode pool before you send your cryptocurrency."
%%%.staking.faqs.4.question%%%,"Which cryptocurrencies do you support?"
%%%.staking.faqs.4.answer%%%,"Our first masternode pool will be for TomoChain. You’ll be able to stake TOMO for a reward of {reward}%. We’ll add other masternode pools in time. "
%%%.staking.faqs.5.question%%%,"Where is my cryptocurrency stored?"
%%%.staking.faqs.5.answer%%%,"Like all masternodes, your cryptocurrency is stored in a smart contract escrow on the blockchain. Constant doesn’t take custody of your cryptocurrency. You can verify your stake at any time using your cryptocurrency’s blockchain explorer."
%%%.staking.faqs.6.question%%%,"Can I withdraw my stake at anytime?"
%%%.staking.faqs.6.answer%%%,"Yes, you can withdraw your stake and earned interest at any time. However, to avoid network disruption, withdrawing from a masternode is not instant. Actual withdrawal times vary by blockchain. For TOMO, for example, withdrawals will take two days. As we add more cryptocurrencies to the masternode pool we’ll advise withdrawal times for each one."
%%%.staking.faqs.7.question%%%,"How is interest paid?"
%%%.staking.faqs.7.answer%%%,"Interest is paid directly into your Constant account every 30 minutes. You’ll receive interest in the same cryptocurrency as the one you stake. For example, if you’re staking TOMO, you’ll earn TOMO interest. This is common across multiple blockchains."
%%%.staking.faqs.8.question%%%,"Can I stake using loan collateral?"
%%%.staking.faqs.8.answer%%%,"Yes. If you’re borrowing against your collateral through our platform, you can offset the staking rewards against the cost of the loan. Exactly how much you can offset depends on your collateral, the staking rewards, and the duration of your staking and borrowing term. We’ll determine this mathematically and give you a revised rate before you begin staking."

                  <p>I love this platform, it is such a hidden gem that more people should know about. I've already been investing my money and making my 8%. Its so easy to deposit and withdraw. And your money makes 4% just sitting there when it's not in loan. That is an INSANE rate compared to other platforms or banks that offer between .01% to 1.7%. You literally cannot beat this and I am sure you guys are going to blow up big one day soon.</p>

                  <p>I have been using constant and love their setup for investing! I was very skeptical at first because it seemed too good to be true but in reality it is that great! Ultimately there is no fee to transfer money in or out, and it allows you to invest any amount of money for any rate that you would wish. Normally if I invest any sum of money for around 10% interest it is then matched to a borrower and I am able to earn the interest. If you go too high on the rate you don t lose anything but you also will not be matched to make money on your investment. It also lets you choose for how long to invest. Let me know if you have questions and I would be happy to explain more. My recommendation would be to set up an account and deposit a small amount to test it for yourself to get the hang of it.</p>

                  <p>FYI - I’ve used MyConstant without problems since 2019 - I have a substantial chunk of change invested with no problems or $$ losses. It’s a similar business platform as Worthy Bonds (offering secured loans) where I invested too - but Worthy financial uses business assets as collateral for that loan, which is riskier as those assets can drop in value in times like these and are harder to liquidate if a business defaults on their loan. I like MyConstant approach to secured lending better and just moved more $$ from my Worthy Bonds and Wealthfront accounts to MyConstant. I invested with Fundrise, Diversyfund and others that deliver good returns on investment - I’ve had 0 losses this past decade. I manage investments in my solo 401k too.</p>

          The $50 cashback rewards and STAR bonus are <strong>one-off rewards only</strong>. The other benefits last as long as your points do. You earn a point for every dollar you invest or borrow and each point expires after 180 days.

          If you invest several times to reach the minimum, your rewards will last 180 days from the first qualifying point you earned. For example, if you invest $10,000 and then $15,000 three months later, your benefits will continue until your first batch of points expire.

        <p>If it’s your first time here, I’d love to tell you a little about who we are and what we do.</p>
        <p>Like many stories, ours has a few twists and turns. So let’s rewind to January 2019 when it all began…</p>
        <p>Back then, we were a humble stablecoin project. A team of economists, engineers, and creatives looking to make money more useful.</p>
      "

%%%.ourStory.b2.title1%%%,"Back then, we were a humble stablecoin project"
%%%.ourStory.b2.content1%%%,"
        <p>We had developed an efficient, borderless, and stable digital currency, backed by the US Dollar, which we launched at CES 2019 in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Our stablecoin (CONST) offered stability for people in troubled economies:</p>
        <p>- It cut the cost of international transfers.</p>
        <p>- It slashed processing times from days to minutes.</p>
        <p>- gave everyone access to a free USD account.</p>
        <p>But we wanted to do more…</p>
      "
%%%.ourStory.b3.title1%%%,"We wanted to help people grow their money."
%%%.ourStory.b3.content1%%%,"
        <p>Like the rest of the world, we’d experienced first-hand the problems with traditional banking. The miserable interest rates, the huge fees, the slow, inefficient systems…</p>
        <p>So, we began thinking about how we could pay a great interest rate on our stablecoin.</p>
        <p>Digital currencies are versatile. They move quickly, freely, and are protected by the blockchain technology underpinning them – surely we could put those efficiency savings to work?</p>
        <p>After a lot of discussion, we set our sights on an industry that – until now – has had a mixed reputation: peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. </p>
        <p>The problem with P2P lending, as we saw it, was too much centralization and too little use of collateral. P2P lenders were doing what banks did – setting rates, evaluating risk, and so on. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, this takes control away from you, the customer. </p>
        <p>So, we built a P2P lending platform that would do two things:</p>

%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer1%%%,"
        <p>We’ve partnered with loan originators (companies that source borrowers) to offer you a greater choice of loans and better returns. A Loan Originator investment is a claim against a loan issued by our loan originator partner. Instead of buying the loan with all the rights and ownership of collateral (if any), you’re buying a right to receive payments from an existing loan. </p>
        <p>When you invest in a Loan Originator, the loan originator will guarantee to buy back the loan if the borrower defaults for 60 days. This repays your principal and earned profit up to and including the 60-day default period. </p>
        "
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question2%%%,"How do Loan Originator loans work?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer2%%%,"When you invest in a Loan Originator loan, you’re lending to a borrower through one of our loan origination partners. Depending on the loan originator, you might receive monthly repayments of the total due, monthly payments of the interest only, or everything at the end of the term – all of which you can withdraw when paid. If the borrower is 60 days late on any of these repayments, the loan originator will buy back the loan and return your principal and earned profit."
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question3%%%,"What is a loan originator?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer3%%%,"A loan originator is a partner that sources borrowers on our behalf. Some arrange loans for borrowers with collateral – such as cars or property – while others assess borrowers’ credit before issuing loans. In either case, our loan originators all come with a buy-back guarantee. That means if their borrowers default for 60 days or more, the loan originator will buy back the loan, returning your principal and earned profit."
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question4%%%,"How do you choose loan originators?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer4%%%,"<p>Before we onboard a lending company onto our platform, we conduct a thorough due diligence process and analysis of the lending company's profile, background, corporate documents, lending practice and credit policy, historical loan performance as well as their financial strengths. </p>
<p>During this process, we review how the lending company lends to its borrowers, how it conducts its loan monitoring as well as how it pursues the debt recovery process in the event of default. We analyze the key indicators of the lending company's operational control, risk management, and most importantly, its financial health via its audited and interim financial statements.</p>
<p>We also take into account management experience and qualifications and the lending company's transparency and openness. All assessments of these indicators are input into our rating model and we assign a Constant Rating to the lending company.</p>"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question5%%%,"How do you calculate a loan originator’s Constant Rating?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer5%%%,"
        <p>We give every loan originator a rating between A and D, A being the best. We only work with C-rated companies and above. Our rating system gives you a guide to the quality of the loans and the loan originator themselves, which determines the risk of lending to that loan originator. </p>
<p>To calculate a rating, we consider many factors, including (but not limited to):</p> 
<ul>
<li>Years of operation.</li>
<li>Country of operation.</li>
<li>Share of the market.</li>
<li>Reputation.</li>
<li>Growth rate.</li>
<li>Risk management.</li>
<li>Transparency.</li>
<li>Financial strength.</li>

%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question6%%%,"What’s the difference between a Loan Originator loan and a crypto-backed loan?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer6%%%,"
        <p>Loan Originator loans offer longer terms (6-15 months) and better interest rates (up to 11% APR). Depending on the loan originator, you might also receive monthly repayments that you can withdraw immediately, whereas crypto-backed borrowers usually repay at the end of the term.</p> 
<p>A Loan Originator loan is secured by the loan originator. If borrowers default for a minimum of 60 days, the loan originator will buy back the loan. This returns your principal and earned profit up to and including the 60-day default period.</p> 
<p>A crypto-backed loan is secured by collateral. If borrowers default or their collateral falls too much in value, we sell it to repay you. This is usually instant, depending on how quickly we can sell the collateral.</p> 
<p>Those are the key differences, but you can see a full comparison on our Loan Originator homepage.</p> 

        "
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question7%%%,"How do you protect my investment on a Loan Originator loan?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer7%%%,"
        <p>First, you have the loan originator’s buy-back guarantee. If borrowers default for 60 days, the loan originator will buy back the loan to return your principal and earned profit up to and including the 60-day period. However, since you rely on the loan originator’s ability to buy back the loan, we’ve given each of them a rating.</p> 
<p>The Constant Rating is based on the loan originator’s business and performance, including the default rate, their stake in each loan, and types of loan offered. You can use the Constant Rating to choose between loan originators, but please remember it is just a guide. A high Constant Rating doesn’t guarantee the loan originator will buy back the loan in all cases.</p>
<p>Like all investment, use caution and diversify.</p>"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question8%%%,"Does the buy-back guarantee protect me in all cases?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer8%%%,"
        <p>In most cases, but not all. Since the loan originator buys back the loan, it depends on their ability to do so, and that’s why we give them a Constant rating from A to D, A being the best. Most of the loans we offer will be C or above. </p>
        <p>Also, certain countries allow borrowers to request extensions on loans. In this case, an extension isn’t considered a default, so you might wait a bit longer for your returns. If the borrower still hasn’t repaid in full by the end of the extension, the loan originator will buy back the loan as usual. </p>
        "
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.question9%%%,"What happens if a loan originator doesn’t honor the buy-back guarantee?"
%%%.loanOriginators.faqs.answer9%%%,"We don’t expect this to happen, but if it does, there are several options available to us. If they can’t honor the buy-back guarantee due to financial issues, we may negotiate a repayment plan with the loan originator and repay you in full or periodically as they repay. Otherwise, you or us may wish to pursue legal action against the loan originator. In either case, we can’t make any assurances and ask that you diversify across different loan originators to spread your risk. "

<p>Zelle is faster, but you can only send a certain amount per day. </p>

<p>Once we receive your funds, we then forward them to the loan originator. This might take 3 to 10 business days depending on the loan originator, as some of them only do weekly settlement. We’ll let you know as soon as your funds have been matched and you’ve started earning interest.</p>
