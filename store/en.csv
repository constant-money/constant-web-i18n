    <p>We work with independent third-party financial institutions such as Prime Trust to provide cash management for the fiat deposits backing Constant tokens, ensuring that all Constant tokens in circulation are matched by an equal amount of fiat deposits. To achieve this, the fiat deposits backing Constant are held in one or more depository accounts at US banks or trust companies whose deposits may be insured.</p>

%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question1%%%,"How long will it take to find a match?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer1%%%,"This depends on the rates and terms you set. Market levels normally result in immediate (or near-immediate) matches, so we update the market rates on the website regularly. If you choose a lower interest rate, it might take a little longer to find you a suitable match."
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question2%%%,"Do you check my credit score?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer2%%%,"As Constant only offers secured loans backed by collateral, there is no need for credit scoring. All you need is adequate collateral to secure your loan. To see how much collateral you’ll need to secure your loan, simply enter the amount you’d like to borrow. The calculator will work out the amount for you."
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question3%%%,"How do you protect my collateral?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer3%%%,"Your collateral is held safely in an Ethereum powered smart contract escrow. This means no one can touch it – not even us. When you repay, your collateral is immediately transferred back to you."
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question4%%%,"What happens if I don’t repay the loan?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer4%%%,"If you don’t repay the loan, we’ll create a sell order for your collateral at 110% of the loan value + interest due to repay investors. Please note the final price may be higher or lower depending on the point of sale, but we’ll always try to get the best price possible for you. You get to keep the loan as well as any difference left over from the sale. That’s it."
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question5%%%,"What happens if my crypto collateral falls in value?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer5%%%,"We will notify you three times at 5% intervals before your collateral falls to 110% of the loan value + interest to date. At that point, we’ll create a sell order to repay the investor. The final price might differ depending on the point of sale, but we’ll always try to get you the best price possible. Any difference will be refunded to you. Borrowers will receive notifications at 125%, 120% and 115%, so they can choose to repay early to avoid liquidation, or top up more collateral. In the event of a flash crash, collateral will be automatically liquidated at 110%."
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question6%%%,"Can I repay early?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer6%%%,"
          <p>If you'd like to pay back your loan before 75% of the term is up, that's absolutely fine. You simply have to pay interest for the days you are in possession of the loan, and just 50% of the original interest rate for the remaining days of the term.</p>
          <p>If you'd like to pay back your loan after 75% of the term is up and claim back your collateral, that's also fine, but the interest due on that loan is the full percentage for the entire term.</p>
        "
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question7%%%,"Can i recall excess if my collateral value increases?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer7%%%,"Yes. If the value of your collateral rises during your loan term, you can withdraw the difference. You’ll be able to do this on the site in the next release scheduled for the 25th of June, but in the meantime, our support team is available via telegram, email, and fb chat to assist you manually."
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question8%%%,"What is the LTV (Loan to Value) Ratio? Is it always the same?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer8%%%,"
          <p>The LTV ratio for 1 year loans or shorter is 66%. That means we require 150% of the loan value in collateral. For each month after the first year, we require an extra 5% of the loan value in collateral.</p>
          <p>For example, if you were to request a loan for 15 months, the collateral due would be 150% + (3*5)% = 165% of the loan value in collateral, which brings your LTV ratio to 60.6%.</p>
        "
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.question9%%%,"How do I make repayment?"
%%%.home.constantLoan.faqs.answer9%%%,"
          <p>We’ll deduct your repayment directly from your Constant account balance. Adding funds is easy. You can do one or a combination of the following:</p>
          <p>1) Transfer USD to one of our FDIC-insured bank accounts</p>
          <p>2) Send CONST to your Constant Wallet</p>

%%%.home.prvLoan.faqs.answer5%%%,"If you'd like to pay back your loan before 75% of the term is up, that's absolutely fine. 
        You pay interest for the days you are in possession of the loan, and just 50% of the original interest rate for the remaining days of the term.
        <br/>
        If you'd like to pay back your loan after 75% of the term is up and claim back your collateral, that's also fine, but the interest due on that loan is the full percentage for the entire term."
%%%.home.prvLoan.faqs.question6%%%,"Can I recall excess collateral if the value increases?"
%%%.home.prvLoan.faqs.answer6%%%,"We’ll deduct your repayment directly from your Constant account balance. Adding funds is easy. You can do one or a combination of the following:
        <br/>1) Transfer USD to one of our US bank accounts
        <br/>2) Send CONST to your Constant Wallet
        <br/>Or send any one of our supported stablecoins:
        <br/>USDT/USDC/TUSD/GUSD/PAX/USDS
        <br/>You can also repay using your collateral balance.
        <br/>Your balance will update when funds have been received in your Constant account."
%%%.home.prvLoan.faqs.question7%%%,"What happens if I repay late?"
%%%.home.prvLoan.faqs.answer7%%%,"The grace period for receiving payment is 3 days after your term ends. On the 2nd and 3rd day, you will incur a late fee of 10% of the total interest due."

%%%.faqs.buy.answer2%%%,"
        <p>Yes, simply deposit any local currency on the “Bank” section of the website and we’ll automatically convert it to Constant. You can then transfer Constant for free to any Constant account or Ethereum wallet.</p>

%%%.faqs.buy.question3%%%,"How much does Constant cost to buy?"
%%%.faqs.buy.answer3%%%,"
        <p>You can buy Constant from our network for $1 per 1 Constant. The price should be similar on exchanges, but because we can’t control the market, it might differ due to supply and demand.</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.sell.question1%%%,"Where can I sell Constant?"
%%%.faqs.sell.answer1%%%,"
        <p>You can sell Constant to us at $1 each. Simply select withdraw from the “Bank” section of our website and we’ll send USD (or local currency) to your bank account. If your Constant is in a separate wallet, you’ll need to transfer it to your Constant account first before you can withdraw it (this is free).</p>
        <br />
        <p>You can also sell Constant on exchanges, but please bear in mind the market price might differ from the one we guarantee on our site. This is because we can’t control the market, and exchange prices will vary depending on supply and demand.</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.value.question1%%%,"Will the price of Constant go “to the moon”?"
%%%.faqs.value.answer1%%%,"
        <p>Constant is a stablecoin designed to always match the value of USD. However, we can’t control the market, nor the effect of supply and demand, so you never know what price Constant will be. In some cases, people will pay more for stability. All we can guarantee is that you can always buy or redeem Constant from us for $1.</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.value.question2%%%,"Why is Constant’s price different on exchanges?"
%%%.faqs.value.answer2%%%,"
        <p>Exchanges connect buyers and sellers, and the price of an asset is determined by the forces of supply and demand – the price people are willing to pay based on the asset’s perceived value. The more there is of an asset, the cheaper it is (usually), and vice versa.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Since Constant is a stablecoin pegged to the USD, you might be surprised to see its price higher or lower on exchanges. This is outside of our control, and entirely set by the market. Some people will pay a premium for stability, for example.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Regardless, no matter what happens, we guarantee you can buy or redeem Constant for $1 from us.</p>

%%%.faqs.collateral.answer2%%%,"
        <p>If the value of your collateral falls below 70% of the original market rate, we liquidate (sell) your crypto and you can keep the loan without repaying it.</p>
        <p>For example, if you borrow $100 and at the time of borrowing your collateral is worth $150, then if it falls below $105, we’ll sell your collateral and you keep the $100.</p>

        <p>To get a loan, you must provide bitcoin or ethereum collateral to the value of 150% of your loan amount. This is called overcollateralization and is essential to offer you the best interest rates and to protect our investors.</p>
        <p>Your crypto collateral is stored and secured on the blockchain, accessible only through private keys that we encrypt on our database. It remains securely protected by the blockchain until you repay the loan and we return your crypto.</p>

Since we’re loaning you Constant, you repay in Constant, too, which you can buy from us or from exchanges. </p>
        <p>Crypto Loans are very simple. If you don’t repay the loan, or if your collateral falls below 70% of its original market value, we keep and sell your crypto. The loan is yours to keep.</p>
        <p>Overcollateralization is a safety mechanism designed to give our investors confidence and our borrowers the friendliest rates on the market. Constant Crypto Loans are one of the safest and easiest loans to obtain, manage, and repay.</p>

%%%.faqs.tech.question1%%%,"Why do you digitize my investment?"
%%%.faqs.tech.answer1%%%,"
        <p>When you invest money for the long term, some local currencies can lose value due to inflation. This eats into your investment income, diminishing your returns. We don’t think that’s fair. So instead, we convert your principal into a “digital dollar” that’s 100% backed by real USD – the world’s reserve currency.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Our digital dollar is called Constant. Anytime you invest or withdraw, we create or destroy Constant to ensure it’s 1:1 backed, always matching the value of USD. That way, you never need worry about inflation and other economic pressures eating into your investment. You just sit back and watch your money grow.</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.tech.question2%%%,"How does digitization work?"
%%%.faqs.tech.answer2%%%,"
        <p>First, we send your investment principal to the Constant Vault for safekeeping. Then, we create new Constant tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that match the USD value of your principal. For example, if you gave us the equivalent of $100 in your local currency, we send $100 to the Constant Vault and create 100 Constant.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Constant remains in your account for your commitment period, earning investment income that you can save or withdraw daily. Then, when your period ends, you can withdraw your principal from the Constant Vault (and any returns) and we’ll destroy the Constant. Or, if you’d rather use the Constant tokens to send money abroad, trade on exchanges, or reinvest for another period, please do!</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.withdraw.question1%%%,"How do I withdraw Constant?"
%%%.faqs.withdraw.answer1%%%,"
        <p>Constant works with your local banking system so you can withdraw in USD or local currency. Although we store your deposits as USD, they’ll be automatically converted back into your local currency (at the real-time market rate) if you withdraw to a non-USD bank account.</p>
        <br />
        <p>To withdraw funds, simply request the amount you’d like to withdraw from the Withdraw tab, enter the bank details, and click Withdraw. Alternatively, you can also withdraw funds as Constant, our USD-backed stablecoin, to an ETH or EOS wallet. Just enter the wallet address and click Withdraw.</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.withdraw.question2%%%,"In which currencies can I withdraw?"
%%%.faqs.withdraw.answer2%%%,"
        <p>The currency you withdraw depends on the native currency of your bank account. If you have a USD bank account, you’ll receive USD. In all other cases, your bank will convert the USD we send to your local currency.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Of course, you don’t have to withdraw to a bank account at all. You can withdraw your money as Constant, our USD-backed stablecoin, to an ETH or EOS wallet and then trade it for other currency pairs on supported exchanges.</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.withdraw.question3%%%,"Do you charge withdrawal fees?"
%%%.faqs.withdraw.answer3%%%,"
        <p>
        The Constant Vault, where we store your funds, is a US-based escrow account. So, withdrawing from this to a bank outside the US will incur a small one-off fee to cover KYC (Know Your Customer). The fee depends on your country of residence, but won’t be more than $35, and you only pay it once. Afterwards, <b>all withdrawals are free.</b>

        <p>Since the Constant Vault is regulated under US law, your deposits are FDIC-insured to $5,000,000. (We split deposits greater than $250,000 across 20 banks to achieve protection up to $5,000,000).</p>

%%%.faqs.transfer.answer3%%%,"<p>You can send funds to anyone, anywhere, anytime.</p>"
%%%.faqs.transfer.question4%%%,"How do transfers work?"
%%%.faqs.transfer.answer4%%%,"
        <p>We use blockchain technology to make our transfers fast, free, and easy.</p>
        <br />
        <p>When you transfer USD, we digitize it in the form of our USD-backed stablecoin, Constant. Since Constant lives on the blockchain, it can be moved to anyone in the world for free – as quickly as sending an email.</p>
        <br />
        <p>At the other end, once your recipient receives Constant, they can then withdraw it again as USD or local currency (depending on their bank account).</p>,
        <p>Here’s a simple example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You request a transfer of $100 to Mary.</li>
          <li>We deduct $100 from your balance and send Mary 100 Constant.</li>
          <li>Mary receives 100 Constant and her balance increases by $100.</li>
          <li>Mary withdraws $100 and we deduct $100 from her balance.</li>
        </ul>
      "
%%%.faqs.transfer.question5%%%,"Are transfers safe?"
%%%.faqs.transfer.answer5%%%,"
        <p>Yes – very safe. First, transfers take place on the blockchain, an immutable public ledger that’s extremely tough to hack. It’s virtually impossible to make fraudulent changes without getting noticed since transactions are collectively validated by the network. Even if your money went astray, it would be easy to trace.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Second, the blockchain is always on. There is no risk of downtime and no way for your money to get lost. It either reaches the recipient or stays in your account. Nevertheless, both your and the recipient’s Constant account are both FDIC-insured to $5,000,000. So were the worst to happen, we’ve got you covered.</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.transfer.question6%%%,"Does the recipient need a Constant account to receive funds?"
%%%.faqs.transfer.answer6%%%,"<p>To receive funds, your recipient needs either a Constant account or a web wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens. That way they can either receive USD or our USD-backed stablecoin, both of which can be withdrawn as USD or local currency (if the recipient doesn’t have a USD bank account).</p>"
%%%.faqs.account.question1%%%,"Can I open a Constant account in my country?"

%%%.faqs.account.question2%%%,"How do I open a Constant account?"
%%%.faqs.account.answer2%%%,"Simply register with an email address and password to get started. To withdraw returns from your free $1,000 initial investment, you’ll need to verify your ID, which shouldn’t take more than a few minutes."
%%%.faqs.account.question3%%%,"What is the minimum capital?"
%%%.faqs.account.answer3%%%,"You can invest any amount you want. Better yet, once you’ve opened your account, we’ll give you a free initial investment of $1,000 so you can start earning investment income immediately. The $1,000 principal is returned to us at the end of your term (sorry!), but you keep the ROI. Not bad, right?"
%%%.faqs.account.question4%%%,"Do you need to verify my identity?"
%%%.faqs.account.answer4%%%,"You can open a Constant account without verifying your identity. However, to withdraw earned investment income on your $1,000 initial investment (or any other investment amount), we will need to verify your identity. We do this to protect you from fraud and to comply with financial regulations."

%%%.faqs.account.answer6%%%,"You don't need a bank account to use Constant.

%%%.faqs.initialInvestment.answer3%%%,"While we’d love to give you $1,000, we can’t. The $1,000 will be returned to us at the end of your commitment period, but you keep the returns, which is still a pretty good deal."
%%%.faqs.initialInvestment.question4%%%,"How can I track the returns from this promotion?"
%%%.faqs.initialInvestment.answer4%%%,"Just log into your account and click Your Investments. Total earned investment income is on the top right of the dashboard."
%%%.faqs.initialInvestment.question5%%%,"What happens at the end of my commitment period?"
%%%.faqs.initialInvestment.answer5%%%,"At the end of the term, we’ll pay you the total profit (assuming you haven’t withdrawn it already) and the $1,000 principal will be returned to us. Please note that we will need to verify your identity before you can withdraw investment income to your bank account. This protects you from fraud and complies with financial regulations."
%%%.faqs.initialInvestment.question6%%%,"Can I invest more in the initial investment promotion?"

%%%.faqs.initialInvestment.question7%%%,"Can I choose different commitment periods for other Investment Plans?"
%%%.faqs.initialInvestment.answer7%%%,"Absolutely! Participation in the initial investment promotion is separate from your other Investment Plans, so you can choose the amounts and terms for your other investments."
%%%.faqs.invest.question1%%%,"What is a Constant Investment Plan?"
%%%.faqs.invest.answer1%%%,"Our Investment Plans are simple, low-risk, and effective ways to grow your money. You choose a commitment period, invest your money, and at the end of the period you get your money back plus earned investment income. It really is as simple as that."
%%%.faqs.invest.question2%%%,"How do Constant Investment Plans work?"
%%%.faqs.invest.answer2%%%,"
        <p>Under the “INVEST” tab on our website, you’ll be able to choose from several different Investment Plans. Each one is designed to maintain the value of your principal investment and pay you daily investment income.</p>
        <br />
        <p>To maintain the value of your principal, we send your money to the Constant Vault where it’s protected by US law and insured to $5,000,000. Over time, your Constant earns investment income which you can withdraw as you earn (daily) or save until the end of your commitment period.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Of course, you don’t have to withdraw your principal and investment income. You can transfer your money abroad, leave it locked to the USD for stability, or simply reinvest in another Investment Plan to earn even more interest. The choice is yours!</p>
      "
%%%.faqs.invest.question3%%%,"How do you protect my investment?"
%%%.faqs.invest.answer3%%%,"Your principal is securely held in the Constant Vault, which is overseen by an accredited US financial institution called Prime Trust.

        We lend your savings to borrowers so we can pay you better interest rates. Aside from seeing your money grow, you won’t notice any changes to your Savings Plan. There’s no risk to you as all our loans are overcollateralized, meaning we only lend to people who put up collateral worth more than the loan. If someone doesn’t repay, we sell collateral on the market. This guarantees we can always return your savings and pay you interest.

%%%.faqs.returns.question1%%%,"How are my returns paid out?"

%%%.faqs.returns.question2%%%,"How are my daily returns calculated?"
%%%.faqs.returns.answer2%%%,"Your rate of return is calculated by applying the percentage rate of your Investment Plan to the amount of your principal, and then dividing it by 365 to get a daily rate. Your returns are not compounded, so if you invest $500 for one year at a rate of 8%, you would earn $40 investment income at the end of your commitment period (about $0.11 per day)."

        <p>Constant is the first fully secured P2P lending platform. All investor funds are fully backed by collateral, and all portions that are not yet on loan are covered by FDIC insurance.

        <p>Unlike other platforms, Constant also allows users to set their own interest rates and terms.

    <h5>Financial freedom looks different for everyone. It’s having the money to do what you want to do. Or simply having enough to never have to worry. Freedom is being able to make your money work for you - so you don’t have to. Freedom is having money that allows you to travel, work and live - anywhere in the world - and thrive.</h5>
    <h5>Today’s generations are thinking bigger, but financial systems are still landlocked and insular, characterized by exclusivity, operating behind closed doors. People are trapped in centralized systems designed to profit a select few. Money sits languishing in even the best bank accounts, steadily losing value as inflation rises. Loans are hard to access, and even more difficult to repay. It is easier to fly to some places than it is to send money there. Billions of global-thinking people are lack the means or opportunity to even begin thinking about financial freedom.</h5>

        <h5>Financial freedom looks different for everyone. It’s having the money to do what you want to do. Or simply having enough to never have to worry. Freedom is being able to make your money work for you - so you don’t have to. Freedom is having money that allows you to travel, work and live - anywhere in the world - and thrive.</h5>
        <br />
        <h5>Today’s generations are thinking bigger, but financial systems are still landlocked and insular, characterized by exclusivity, operating behind closed doors. People are trapped in centralized systems designed to profit a select few. Money sits languishing in even the best bank accounts, steadily losing value as inflation rises. Loans are hard to access, and even more difficult to repay. It is easier to fly to some places than it is to send money there. Billions of global-thinking people are lack the means or opportunity to even begin thinking about financial freedom.</h5>

%%%.deposit1.faqs.question1%%%,"What is Flex?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer1%%%,"Flex is a deposit account that earns you 4% APY through automatic lending. When you deposit money into Flex, it goes into a liquidity pool managed by Compound Finance. Borrowers who’ve put up collateral can then secure loans from the pool in return for interest – and we pay that interest to you. Since your deposits go to a pool rather than individual borrowers, you can withdraw or deposit anytime, as often as you like, and without any fees. "
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question2%%%,"Why 4% APY?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer2%%%,"Compound Finance uses a blockchain protocol that intelligently manages the lending pool. It also sets interest rates according to supply and demand. At the moment, the rate is fixed at 4% APY. In the future, it could be higher or lower depending on activity in Compound’s lending market."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question3%%%,"What is Compound Finance?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer3%%%,"Compound Finance is a technology that intelligently manages a lending pool of over $150 million in assets (as of September 2019). Flex interfaces with this technology through an API that allows you to withdraw your deposits and earned interest at any time. <br/>Compound Finance lends in a similar way to banks: your deposits go in and are lent to borrowers in exchange for interest and collateral. But since Compound Finance is a technology, there is no need for branches or staff, so you enjoy a much better interest rate!<br> <a href=""https://compound.finance/"">Learn more about Compound Finance.</a>"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question4%%%,"Do you have a referral program for Flex?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer4%%%,"Yes, we do. For every friend you refer to Flex, you’ll get 10% of their interest earnings for the first year (up to a maximum of $1,000,000). For more details, <a href=""/referral"">visit your Referrals page.</a>"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question5%%%,"Can I withdraw anytime?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer5%%%,"Yes. Since you’re not lending your deposits to an individual, but to a lending pool, you can deposit or withdraw as much and as often as you like."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question6%%%,"How do my deposits earn interest?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer6%%%,"Flex uses an API with Compound Finance to lend your deposits to a liquidity pool. Others borrow from the pool in return for putting up collateral, and you earn the interest. In other words, Flex is very similar to how investments work on Constant, only with Flex you can withdraw anytime."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question7%%%,"Are my deposits insured?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer7%%%,"Not always, no. While held with our trust partner, Prime Trust, your deposits are covered by a $130,000,000 insurance policy. However, we expect deposits will spend most of their time earning interest through Compound Finance, so will instead be protected by collateral put up by Compound's users."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question8%%%,"Can I deposit collateral or other cryptocurrency into Flex?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer8%%%,"At the moment, Flex only accepts USD and USD-backed stablecoins."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question9%%%,"Can I earn interest while waiting for an investment order to match?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer9%%%,"No, your funds are set aside while waiting for a match so won't earn interest on Flex. If you decide to cancel the order, your funds will return to earning interest in Flex."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question10%%%,"Will the interest rate change?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer10%%%,"The interest rate depends on supply and demand in Compound's lending market. Sometimes it's higher, sometimes it's lower, but for the time being we've fixed this at 4% APY."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question11%%%,"Are there any fees?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer11%%%,"No – all deposits and withdrawals on Flex are free."
%%%.deposit1.faqs.question12%%%,"How does Constant make money?"
%%%.deposit1.faqs.answer12%%%,"Flex deposits earn interest through an API with Compound Finance, another lending platform. Compound sets interest rates according to supply and demand, and Constant will make a slim profit on any difference between the Flex and Compound rates."

%%%.airdrop.faqs.question1%%%,"What is Constant peer-to-peer lending?"
%%%.airdrop.faqs.answer1%%%,"
        <p>Unlike bank loans, P2P lending works by matching investors and borrowers directly. Since there are no greedy middlemen getting in the way, you set your own terms and rates, giving you unparalleled control of your finances. So whether you’re looking for a low-interest loan or better returns on your investment, we’ll match you with someone who’d love to do business with you.</p>
       "
%%%.airdrop.faqs.question2%%%,"What is STAR?"
%%%.airdrop.faqs.answer2%%%,"
        <p>STAR is an ERC20 token which can be redeemed for 1% bonus or discounted interest, or sent to someone as a gift. 1 STAR unlocks either +1% APR on an investment or -1% APR on a loan. You can use up to 3 STAR at one time.</p>
        <p>The great news is all STAR rewards apply to the whole term. To redeem STAR, simply go to your <a href=""/accounts"" class=""underline bold"">Accounts</a> page and select an active loan or investment, and then choose how many to redeem.</p>
      "
%%%.airdrop.faqs.question3%%%,"Can I trade STAR on exchanges?"
%%%.airdrop.faqs.answer3%%%,"
        <p>No, not yet. STAR is only usable on the Constant platform but can still be transferred to other ERC20 wallets. Check out the smart contract on <a href=""https://etherscan.io/token/0x9027ba8450b1c9bdfad6506190803873391e8e6f"" class=""underline bold"" target=""_blank"">Etherscan</a>.</p>
      "
%%%.airdrop.faqs.question4%%%,"What makes Constant different from other P2P lending platforms?"
%%%.airdrop.faqs.answer4%%%,"
        <p>Constant is the first fully secured P2P lending platform. All investor funds are 150% backed by cryptocurrency collateral. Borrower collateral is stored safely in escrow, which means no one can touch it until it is transferred back to the borrower after repayment.</p>
        <p>Unlike other platforms, Constant also allows users to set their own interest rates and terms. Ethereum powered smart contracts automate the loan agreement and always run exactly as programmed – ensuring both investors and borrowers are protected.</p>
      "
%%%.airdrop.faqs.question5%%%,"Who can participate in STARdrop?"

%%%.staking.learnMoreFAQs%%%,"check out our FAQs."
%%%.staking.faqs.1.question%%%,"What is a masternode?"
%%%.staking.faqs.1.answer%%%,"A masternode is a member of a blockchain network that stores an entire copy of the blockchain on their computer at all times. They’re vital to maintaining and securing a blockchain network. To qualify as a masternode, you must first stake a large amount of a blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, which incentivizes the right behavior and discourages fraud. In return for helping maintain the network, masternodes receive a cryptocurrency reward."
%%%.staking.faqs.2.question%%%,"What is a masternode pool?"
%%%.staking.faqs.2.answer%%%,"Rather than one person staking the minimum amount to become a masternode, a masternode pool crowdsources the cryptocurrency from multiple people on the network. This makes it easier to become a masternode for people without the minimum stake, and distributes the rewards among a greater number of people. As a masternode pool further decentralizes a network, it could also be argued it is more secure and democratic."
%%%.staking.faqs.3.question%%%,"Will the staking rewards ever change?"
%%%.staking.faqs.3.answer%%%,"The interest you earn for staking in the masternode pool depends on the blockchain. It’ll be fixed for the beginning of your staking term, but might change during your term or the next time you stake. We’ll make it clear just how much you’ll earn through our masternode pool before you send your cryptocurrency."
%%%.staking.faqs.4.question%%%,"Which cryptocurrencies do you support?"
%%%.staking.faqs.4.answer%%%,"Our first masternode pool will be for TomoChain. You’ll be able to stake TOMO for a reward of {reward}%. We’ll add other masternode pools in time. "
%%%.staking.faqs.5.question%%%,"Where is my cryptocurrency stored?"
%%%.staking.faqs.5.answer%%%,"Like all masternodes, your cryptocurrency is stored in a smart contract escrow on the blockchain. Constant doesn’t take custody of your cryptocurrency. You can verify your stake at any time using your cryptocurrency’s blockchain explorer."
%%%.staking.faqs.6.question%%%,"Can I withdraw my stake at anytime?"
%%%.staking.faqs.6.answer%%%,"Yes, you can withdraw your stake and earned interest at any time. However, to avoid network disruption, withdrawing from a masternode is not instant. Actual withdrawal times vary by blockchain. For TOMO, for example, withdrawals will take two days. As we add more cryptocurrencies to the masternode pool we’ll advise withdrawal times for each one."
%%%.staking.faqs.7.question%%%,"How is interest paid?"
%%%.staking.faqs.7.answer%%%,"Interest is paid directly into your Constant account every 30 minutes. You’ll receive interest in the same cryptocurrency as the one you stake. For example, if you’re staking TOMO, you’ll earn TOMO interest. This is common across multiple blockchains."
%%%.staking.faqs.8.question%%%,"Can I stake using loan collateral?"
%%%.staking.faqs.8.answer%%%,"Yes. If you’re borrowing against your collateral through our platform, you can offset the staking rewards against the cost of the loan. Exactly how much you can offset depends on your collateral, the staking rewards, and the duration of your staking and borrowing term. We’ll determine this mathematically and give you a revised rate before you begin staking."

          The Constant Referral Reward program earns you extra interest for investing or sharing Constant with friends and family. 
          You earn interest by completing certain actions, such as referring Constant to friends who then sign up, 
          sharing Constant on social media, and investing a minimum of $1,000 or more.
          </p>
          <p>
          Complete all actions in our Referral Rewards program and you could earn 6% additional interest on your Investment Plans.

%%%.memberShip.faqs.4.question%%%,"What are Constant Referral Rewards?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.4.answer%%%,"
          <p>No. The membership thresholds apply separately to loans and investments. 
          For example, you must invest $25,000 or borrow $25,000 to qualify for Gold membership.</p>
          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.5.question%%%,"How long do membership rewards last?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.5.answer%%%,"
          <p>
          The $100 cashback and STAR bonuses <strong>are one-off rewards only</strong>. The other benefits last as long as your points do. 
          You earn a point for every dollar you invest or borrow and each point expires after 180 days. So, 
          if you make a single investment of $25,000, for example, your points will last 180 days and so will the benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
          If you invest several times to reach the minimum, your rewards will last 180 days from the first qualifying point you earned. 
          For example, if you invest $10,000 and then $15,000 three months later, your benefits will continue until your first batch of points expire.
           </p>
          "
%%%.memberShip.faqs.6.question%%%,"Can I extend membership rewards?"
%%%.memberShip.faqs.6.answer%%%,"
          <p>
          Yes! When your points expire, simply invest or borrow again to top them up. 
          This way, you can keep your membership benefits for as long as you want them.
           </p>
          "

          No, you don’t need to do anything. We’ll track your investment and loan volume on a rolling six-month basis and when you meet the minimum threshold, 
          we’ll immediately upgrade you to Gold, Platinum or Diamond status. 
          Your rewards are also paid immediately, and the ongoing benefits last as long as your points do.

%%%.trustPilot.comments.2.desc%%%,"I got into crypto about three years ago by buying bitcoin. Since that time I have tried to figure out how to best maximize my investment returns through various crypto platforms and after trying many of the platforms I have settled on two and Constant is one of those. As a lender looking to make a return on investment I could not be more pleased with what Constant does and how they do it. I feel that my capital is well taken care of, the platform allows me to earn outsized returns on “idle” cash that would either be tied up in a low interest bearing account at a bank or exposed to volatility in the stock market or locked up in an illiquid investment for years. Earning a consistent 10% return annual is not easy folks and as far as I can tell, Constant may be one of the only ways of doing that with a minimum amount of risk and relatively high liquidity. Like any investment in crypto, one has to always be mindful of what happens in a really rough bear market and there are no guarantees in life but I think Constant has built a truly standout platform that is well worth considering if you have capital available to invest into the crypto space."

        <p>If it’s your first time here, I’d love to tell you a little about who we are and what we do.</p>
        <p>Like many stories, ours has a few twists and turns. So let’s rewind to January 2019 when it all began…</p>
        <p>Back then, we were a humble stablecoin project. A team of economists, engineers, and creatives looking to make money more useful.</p>

%%%.ourStory.b2.content1%%%,"
        <p>We had developed an efficient, borderless, and stable digital currency, backed by the US Dollar, which we launched at CES 2019 in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Our stablecoin (CONST) offered stability for people in troubled economies:</p>
        <p>- It cut the cost of international transfers.</p>
        <p>- It slashed processing times from days to minutes.</p>
        <p>- gave everyone access to a free USD account.</p>

%%%.ourStory.b3.content1%%%,"
        <p>Like the rest of the world, we’d experienced first-hand the problems with traditional banking. The miserable interest rates, the huge fees, the slow, inefficient systems…</p>
        <p>So, we began thinking about how we could pay a great interest rate on our stablecoin.</p>
        <p>Digital currencies are versatile. They move quickly, freely, and are protected by the blockchain technology underpinning them – surely we could put those efficiency savings to work?</p>
        <p>After a lot of discussion, we set our sights on an industry that – until now – has had a mixed reputation: peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. </p>
        <p>The problem with P2P lending, as we saw it, was too much centralization and too little use of collateral. P2P lenders were doing what banks did – setting rates, evaluating risk, and so on. </p>
        <p>Ultimately, this takes control away from you, the customer. </p>
        <p>So, we built a P2P lending platform that would do two things:</p>
