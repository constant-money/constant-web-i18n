            "question1": "What is a Constant Savings Plan?",
            "answer1": "Our Savings Plans are simple, risk-free, and effective ways to grow your money. You choose a savings term, deposit your money, and at the end of the term you get your money back plus earned interest. It really is as simple as that.",
            "question2": "How do Constant Savings Plans work?",
            "answer2": "\n        <p>Under the “SAVE” tab on our website, you’ll be able to choose from several different Savings Plans. Each one is designed to maintain the value of your deposit and pay you daily interest.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>To maintain the value of your deposit, we send your money to the Constant trust where it’s protected by US law and insured to $130,000,000. At the same time, we create a “digital dollar” called Constant and put it into your account, which keeps the value stable.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>Over time, your Constant earns interest which you can withdraw as you earn (daily) or save until the end of your term. Either way, your savings balance is an amount in Constant you can withdraw for its 1:1 equivalent in USD.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>Of course, you don’t have to withdraw your savings as USD. At the end of your term, we put your savings into our Anytime Savings Plan so you continue to earn interest while you decide what to do next.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>You could send your Constant to someone else, anywhere in the world, keep it stored in your Constant current account to keep the value locked to the USD, or simply put the Constant back into another Savings Plan to earn even more interest. The choice is yours!</p>\n      ",
            "question3": "How do you protect my savings?",
            "answer3": "Your deposits are securely held in the Constant Vault, which is overseen by an accredited US financial institution called Prime Trust. The Constant Vault is FDIC-insured to $130,000,000. You can read more about the Constant Vault on our blog.",
            "question4": "Which currencies do you accept?",
            "answer4": "We accept any currency sent to our US-based Constant Vault bank account. It is then converted to USD and stored in an FDIC-insured vault.",
            "question5": "Do you accept cryptocurrency?",
            "answer5": "Not at this time.",
            "question6": "Can I access my savings at any time?",
            "answer6": "\n        <p>To give you the best interest rates, we hold on to your deposit for the duration of your savings term. Think of your savings deposit as a seed that we water and help grow. To do that, we need time, which is why we offer different Savings Plans so you can find the right one for you.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>If you’d rather have continuous access to your savings, choose our Anytime Savings Plan – the rate is lower, but you can withdraw your money at any time.</p>\n        <br />\n      ",
            "question7": "Why do you digitize my savings?",
            "answer7": "\n        <p>When you deposit money for the long term, some local currencies can lose value due to inflation. This eats into your earned interest and makes saving feel like an uphill battle. We don’t think that’s fair. So instead, we convert your money into a “digital dollar” that’s 100% backed by real USD – the world’s reserve currency.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>Our digital dollar is called Constant. Anytime you deposit or withdraw, we create or destroy Constant to ensure it’s 1:1 backed, so its value always matches the USD. That way, you never need worry about inflation and other economic pressures eating into your savings. You just sit back and watch your money grow.</p>\n        <br />\n      ",
            "question8": "How does digitization work?",
            "answer8": "\n        <p>First, we send your deposit to the Constant trust for safekeeping. Then, we create new Constant tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that match the USD value of your deposit. For example, if you gave us the equivalent of $100 in your local currency, we send $100 to the Constant trust and create 100 Constant.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>Constant remains in your account for your savings term, accruing interest which you can save or withdraw daily. Then, when your term ends, you can withdraw your money from the Constant trust (and any interest) and we’ll destroy the Constant. Or, if you’d rather use the Constant tokens to send money abroad, trade on exchanges, or simply save for another term, please do!</p>\n      ",
            "question9": "Where are my savings stored?",
            "answer9": "Your savings are stored inside the Constant Vault, which is regulated under US law and protected by $130,000,000 FDIC insurance.",
            "question10": "Can I add to my Savings Plan during the term?",
            "answer10": "You can’t add to your Savings Plan once it’s started, but there’s no limit on how many Savings Plans you can have. So if you’d like to save more, simply open another Savings Plan and watch your money grow.",
            "question11": "What is the Constant Vault?",
            "answer11": "The Constant Vault is a publicly-audited trust overseen and managed by Prime Trust, a US accredited financial institution. The Constant Vault is regulated in the US and insured by the FDIC to the value of $130,000,000.",
            "question12": "What is FDIC insurance?",
            "answer12": "\n        <p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a body set up by the US government to protect the integrity of the US financial system. It does this in a number of ways, including insuring deposits. Our Constant Vault is insured by FDIC to an indemnity limit of $130,000,000.

        "interest": {
            "question1": "How often do you pay interest?",
            "answer1": "We pay interest daily, so you can either wait until the end of your term to withdraw interest or withdraw it daily. It’s up to you.",
            "question2": "How is interest calculated?",
            "answer2": "Your interest is calculated by applying the percentage rate of your Savings Plan to the amount of your deposit, and then dividing it by 365 to get a daily rate. Interest is not compounded, so if you deposit $500 for one year at an interest rate of 6%, you would earn $30 at the end of your term (about $0.08 per day).",
            "question3": "How can I track interest on my savings?",
            "answer3": "Just log into your account and click Your Savings. Total interest earned is on the top right of the dashboard.",
            "question4": "Will you increase interest rates in the future?",
            "answer4": "\n        <p>You never know ;-)</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>As Constant grows, we’re always looking for new ways of improving our efficiency so we can give you the best savings rates in the world.</p>\n      ",
            "question5": "Why are your interest rates better than those offered by banks?",
            "answer5": "\n        <p>Like other banks, we reward you with interest earnings on our risk-free loans. We can afford to give you more than banks because, one, we believe you deserve it, and two, we operate a much leaner business model.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>We’ve replaced cashiers with code, advisors with algorithms, and run on smart contracts and electricity – we’re an efficient team and don’t need much. Maybe some snacks. Yes, please send us snacks.</p>\n      "

            "answer3": "Yes. Your deposits are held securely in our trust, which is regulated under US law. That’s why we ask you to verify your identity when you withdraw savings to your bank account.",
            "question4": "How does Constant make money?",
            "answer4": "We charge interest on collateralized loans in order to pay our savers their earnings, and make a very slim profit from the difference.",
