Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Borrower defaults in the performance of any obligation under this Agreement, then the Lender may declare the principal amount owing and interest due under this Agreement at that time to be immediately due and payable.</p>\n        <p>6. Further, if the Lender declares the principal amount owing under this Agreement to be immediately due and payable, and the Borrower fails to provide full payment, interest at the rate of 2.00 percent per annum, calculated yearly, not in advance, will be charged on the outstanding amount, commencing the day the principal amount is declared due and payable, until full payment is received by the Lender.</p>\n        <p>7. If the Borrower fails to provide full payment including, without limitation, the interest, all of the guarantors will be banned from the loan service.</p>\n        <u><b>Additional Clauses</b></u>\n        <p>8.
