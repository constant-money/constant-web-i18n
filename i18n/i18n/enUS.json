            "question1": "What is a Constant Savings Plan?",
            "answer1": "Our Savings Plans are simple, risk-free, and effective ways to grow your money. You choose a savings term, deposit your money, and at the end of the term you get your money back plus earned interest. It really is as simple as that.",
            "question2": "How do Constant Savings Plans work?",
            "answer2": "\n        <p>Under the “SAVE” tab on our website, you’ll be able to choose from several different Savings Plans. Each one is designed to maintain the value of your deposit and pay you compounded interest.</p>\n        <br />\n        <p>To maintain the value of your deposit, we convert your savings to USD – the world's reserve currency. Then, we lend your savings to overcollateralized borrowers and share the lending income with you as interest. You can withdraw this interest at the end of your term.\n        <br />\n        <p>There is no risk to you since borrowers give us collateral that exceeds the value of the loan. If they don't repay, we sell their collateral in plenty of time to return your savings and pay you interest. </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>Of course, you don’t have to withdraw your savings. You could send money abroad, store it in your Constant account to keep the value locked to the USD, or start another Savings Plan to earn even more interest. The choice is yours!\n</p>\n      ",
