                "question1": "How long will it take to find a match?",
                "answer1": "This depends on the rates and terms you set. Market levels normally result in immediate (or near-immediate) matches, so we update the market rates on the website regularly. If you choose a lower interest rate, it might take a little longer to find you a suitable match. After you've found a match, the loan will be available in your account within 24 hours (slightly longer for larger amounts).\n",
                "question2": "Do you check my credit score?",
                "answer2": "As Constant only offers secured loans backed by collateral, there is no need for credit scoring. All you need is adequate collateral to secure your loan. To see how much collateral you’ll need to secure your loan, simply enter the amount you’d like to borrow. The calculator will work out the amount for you.",
                "question3": "How do you protect my collateral?",
                "answer3": "Your collateral is held safely in an Ethereum powered smart contract escrow. This means no one can touch it – not even us. When you repay, your collateral is immediately transferred back to you. You also have the option to pay a 1% fee for BitGo custodian protection up to 100M USD.\n",
                "question4": "What happens if I don’t repay the loan?",
                "answer4": "If you don’t repay the loan, we’ll create a sell order for your collateral at 110% of the loan value + interest due to repay investors. Please note the final price may be higher or lower depending on the point of sale, but we’ll always try to get the best price possible for you. You get to keep the loan as well as any difference left over from the sale. That’s it.",
                "question5": "What happens if my crypto collateral falls in value?",
                "answer5": "We will notify you three times at 5% intervals before your collateral falls to 110% of the loan value + interest to date. At that point, we’ll create a sell order to repay the investor. The final price might differ depending on the point of sale, but we’ll always try to get you the best price possible. Any difference will be refunded to you. Borrowers will receive notifications at 125%, 120% and 115%, so they can choose to repay early to avoid liquidation, or top up more collateral. In the event of a flash crash, collateral will be automatically liquidated at 110%.",
                "question6": "Can I repay early?",
                "answer6": "\n          <p>If you'd like to pay back your loan before 75% of the term is up, that's absolutely fine. You simply have to pay interest for the days you are in possession of the loan, and just 50% of the original interest rate for the remaining days of the term.</p>\n          <p>If you'd like to pay back your loan after 75% of the term is up and claim back your collateral, that's also fine, but the interest due on that loan is the full percentage for the entire term.</p>\n        ",
                "question7": "Can i recall excess if my collateral value increases?",
                "answer7": "Yes. If the value of your collateral rises during your loan term, you can withdraw the difference. You’ll be able to do this on the site in the next release scheduled for the 25th of June, but in the meantime, our support team is available via telegram, email, and fb chat to assist you manually.",
                "question8": "What is the LTV (Loan to Value) Ratio? Is it always the same?",
                "answer8": "\n          <p>The LTV ratio for 1 year loans or shorter is 66%. That means we require 150% of the loan value in collateral. For each month after the first year, we require an extra 5% of the loan value in collateral.</p>\n          <p>For example, if you were to request a loan for 15 months, the collateral due would be 150% + (3*5)% = 165% of the loan value in collateral, which brings your LTV ratio to 60.6%.</p>\n        ",
                "question9": "How do I make repayment?",
                "answer9": "\n          <p>We’ll deduct your repayment directly from your Constant account balance. Adding funds is easy. You can do one or a combination of the following:</p>\n          <p>1) Transfer USD to one of our US bank accounts</p>\n          <p>2) Send CONST to your Constant Wallet</p>\n          <p>   Or send any one of our supported stablecoins: </p>\n          <p>   USDT/USDC/TUSD/GUSD/PAX/USDS</p>\n          <p>   Your balance will update when funds have been received in your Constant account.</p>",
                "question10": "What happens if I repay late?",
                "answer10": "The grace period for receiving payment is 3 days after your term ends. On the 2nd and 3rd day, you will incur a late fee of 10% of the total interest due."

            "question1": "What is peer-to-peer (P2P) lending?",
            "answer1": "<p>Unlike bank loans, P2P lending works by matching investors and borrowers directly. Since there are no greedy middlemen getting in the way, you set your own terms and rates, giving you unparalleled control of your finances. So whether you’re looking for a low-interest loan or better returns on your investment, we’ll match you with someone who’d love to do business with you.</p>",
            "question2": "What makes Constant different from other P2P lending platforms?\n",
            "answer2": "        <p>Constant is the first fully secured P2P lending platform. All investor funds are fully backed by collateral. Borrower collateral is stored safely in escrow, which means no one can touch it until it is transferred back to them after repayment.</p>\n        <p>Unlike other platforms, Constant also allows users to set their own interest rates and terms. \n        Ethereum powered smart contracts automate the loan agreement and always run exactly as programmed – ensuring both investors and borrowers are protected.\n        </p>",
            "question3": "Who can participate?",
            "answer3": "<p>Anyone can participate, as long as you have an internet connection (to use our website) and access to a bank account (to receive a loan or repayment).</p>",
            "question4": "How does Constant protect customers’ funds?",
            "answer4": "\n        <p>All of our loans and investments are protected by a combination of Ethereum smart contracts, and crypto collateral.</p>\n        <p>An Ethereum smart contract is an unstoppable programmable ruleset that strictly defines how your money is used. All our borrowers put up 150% of the loan amount in collateral, so investors see a return whether borrowers repay or not.</p>",

            "question1": "What is Flex?",
            "answer1": "Flex is a deposit account that earns you 5% APY through automatic lending. When you deposit money into Flex, it goes into a liquidity pool managed by Compound Finance. Borrowers who’ve put up collateral can then secure loans from the pool in return for interest – and we pay that interest to you. Since your deposits go to a pool rather than individual borrowers, you can withdraw or deposit anytime, as often as you like, and without any fees. ",
            "question2": "Why 5% APY?",
            "answer2": "Compound Finance uses a blockchain protocol that intelligently manages the lending pool. It also sets interest rates according to supply and demand. At the moment, the rate is fixed at 5% APY. In the future, it could be higher or lower depending on activity in Compound’s lending market.",
            "question3": "What is Compound Finance?",
            "answer3": "Compound Finance is a technology that intelligently manages a lending pool of over $150 million in assets (as of September 2019). Flex interfaces with this technology through an API that allows you to withdraw your deposits and earned interest at any time. <br/>Compound Finance lends in a similar way to banks: your deposits go in and are lent to borrowers in exchange for interest and collateral. But since Compound Finance is a technology, there is no need for branches or staff, so you enjoy a much better interest rate!<br> <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Learn more about Compound Finance.</a>",
            "question4": "Do you have a referral program for Flex?",
            "answer4": "Yes, we do. For every friend you refer to Flex, you’ll get 10% of their interest earnings for the first year (up to a maximum of $1,000,000). For more details, <a href=\"/referral\">visit your Referrals page.</a>",
            "question5": "Can I withdraw anytime?",
            "answer5": "Yes. Since you’re not lending your deposits to an individual, but to a lending pool, you can deposit or withdraw as much and as often as you like.",
            "question6": "How do my deposits earn interest?",
            "answer6": "Flex uses an API with Compound Finance to lend your deposits to a liquidity pool. Others borrow from the pool in return for putting up collateral, and you earn the interest. In other words, Flex is very similar to how investments work on Constant, only with Flex you can withdraw anytime.",
            "question7": "Are my deposits insured?",
            "answer7": "Not always, no. While held with our trust partner, Prime Trust, your deposits are covered by a $130,000,000 insurance policy. However, we expect deposits will spend most of their time earning interest through Compound Finance, so will instead be protected by collateral put up by Compound's users.",
            "question8": "Can I deposit collateral or other cryptocurrency into Flex?",
            "answer8": "At the moment, Flex only accepts USD and USD-backed stablecoins.",
            "question9": "Can I earn interest while waiting for an investment order to match?",
            "answer9": "No, your funds are set aside while waiting for a match so won't earn interest on Flex. If you decide to cancel the order, your funds will return to earning interest in Flex.",
            "question10": "Will the interest rate change?",
            "answer10": "The interest rate depends on supply and demand in Compound's lending market. Sometimes it's higher, sometimes it's lower, but for the time being we've fixed this at 5% APY.",
            "question11": "Are there any fees?",
