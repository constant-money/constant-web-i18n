At that point, we’ll create a sell order to repay the investor. The final price might differ depending on the point of sale, but we’ll always try to get you the best price possible. Any difference will be refunded to you. Borrowers will receive notifications at 125%, 120% and 115%, so they can choose to repay early to avoid liquidation, or top up more collateral. In the event of a flash crash, collateral will be automatically liquidated at 110%.",

                "question7": "Can i recall excess if my collateral value increases?",
                "answer7": "Yes. If the value of your collateral rises during your loan term, you can withdraw the difference. You’ll be able to do this on the site in the next release scheduled for the 25th of June, but in the meantime, our support team is available via telegram, email, and fb chat to assist you manually.",

For each month after the first year, we require an extra 5% of the loan value in collateral.</p>\n          <p>For example, if you were to request a loan for 15 months, the collateral due would be 150% + (3*5)% = 165% of the loan value in collateral, which brings your LTV ratio to 60.6%.</p>\n        ",

            "question1": "What is Flex?",
            "answer1": "Flex is a deposit account that earns you 4% APY through automatic lending. When you deposit money into Flex, it goes into a liquidity pool managed by Compound Finance. Borrowers who’ve put up collateral can then secure loans from the pool in return for interest – and we pay that interest to you. Since your deposits go to a pool rather than individual borrowers, you can withdraw or deposit anytime, as often as you like, and without any fees. ",
            "question2": "Why 4% APY?",
            "answer2": "Compound Finance uses a blockchain protocol that intelligently manages the lending pool. It also sets interest rates according to supply and demand. At the moment, the rate is fixed at 4% APY. In the future, it could be higher or lower depending on activity in Compound’s lending market.",
            "question3": "What is Compound Finance?",
            "answer3": "Compound Finance is a technology that intelligently manages a lending pool of over $150 million in assets (as of September 2019). Flex interfaces with this technology through an API that allows you to withdraw your deposits and earned interest at any time. <br/>Compound Finance lends in a similar way to banks: your deposits go in and are lent to borrowers in exchange for interest and collateral. But since Compound Finance is a technology, there is no need for branches or staff, so you enjoy a much better interest rate!<br> <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Learn more about Compound Finance.</a>",
            "question4": "Do you have a referral program for Flex?",
            "answer4": "Yes, we do. For every friend you refer to Flex, you’ll get 10% of their interest earnings for the first year (up to a maximum of $1,000,000). For more details, <a href=\"/referral\">visit your Referrals page.</a>",
            "question5": "Can I withdraw anytime?",
            "answer5": "Yes. Since you’re not lending your deposits to an individual, but to a lending pool, you can deposit or withdraw as much and as often as you like.",
            "question6": "How do my deposits earn interest?",
            "answer6": "Flex uses an API with Compound Finance to lend your deposits to a liquidity pool. Others borrow from the pool in return for putting up collateral, and you earn the interest. In other words, Flex is very similar to how investments work on Constant, only with Flex you can withdraw anytime.",
            "question7": "Are my deposits insured?",
            "answer7": "Not always, no. While held with our trust partner, Prime Trust, your deposits are covered by a $130,000,000 insurance policy. However, we expect deposits will spend most of their time earning interest through Compound Finance, so will instead be protected by collateral put up by Compound's users.",
            "question8": "Can I deposit collateral or other cryptocurrency into Flex?",
            "answer8": "At the moment, Flex only accepts USD and USD-backed stablecoins.",
            "question9": "Can I earn interest while waiting for an investment order to match?",
            "answer9": "No, your funds are set aside while waiting for a match so won't earn interest on Flex. If you decide to cancel the order, your funds will return to earning interest in Flex.",
            "question10": "Will the interest rate change?",
            "answer10": "The interest rate depends on supply and demand in Compound's lending market. Sometimes it's higher, sometimes it's lower, but for the time being we've fixed this at 4% APY.",
            "question11": "Are there any fees?",
            "answer11": "No – all deposits and withdrawals on Flex are free.",
            "question12": "How does Constant make money?",
            "answer12": "Flex deposits earn interest through an API with Compound Finance, another lending platform. Compound sets interest rates according to supply and demand, and Constant will make a slim profit on any difference between the Flex and Compound rates."

        "faqs": {
            "question1": "What is Constant peer-to-peer lending?",
            "answer1": "\n        <p>Unlike bank loans, P2P lending works by matching investors and borrowers directly. Since there are no greedy middlemen getting in the way, you set your own terms and rates, giving you unparalleled control of your finances. So whether you’re looking for a low-interest loan or better returns on your investment, we’ll match you with someone who’d love to do business with you.</p>\n       ",
            "question2": "What is STAR?",
            "answer2": "\n        <p>STAR is an ERC20 token which can be redeemed for 1% bonus or discounted interest, or sent to someone as a gift. 1 STAR unlocks either +1% APR on an investment or -1% APR on a loan. You can use up to 3 STAR at one time.</p>\n        <p>The great news is all STAR rewards apply to the whole term. To redeem STAR, simply go to your <a href=\"/accounts\" class=\"underline bold\">Accounts</a> page and select an active loan or investment, and then choose how many to redeem.</p>\n      ",
            "question3": "Can I trade STAR on exchanges?",
            "answer3": "\n        <p>No, not yet. STAR is only usable on the Constant platform but can still be transferred to other ERC20 wallets. Check out the smart contract on <a href=\"https://etherscan.io/token/0x9027ba8450b1c9bdfad6506190803873391e8e6f\" class=\"underline bold\" target=\"_blank\">Etherscan</a>.</p>\n      ",
            "question4": "What makes Constant different from other P2P lending platforms?",
            "answer4": "\n        <p>Constant is the first fully secured P2P lending platform. All investor funds are 150% backed by cryptocurrency collateral. Borrower collateral is stored safely in escrow, which means no one can touch it until it is transferred back to the borrower after repayment.</p>\n        <p>Unlike other platforms, Constant also allows users to set their own interest rates and terms. Ethereum powered smart contracts automate the loan agreement and always run exactly as programmed – ensuring both investors and borrowers are protected.</p>\n      ",
            "question5": "Who can participate in STARdrop?",
            "answer5": "\n        <p>Anyone can participate, as long as you have an internet connection (to use our website) and sign up for an account on Constant to receive your reward in STAR.</p>\n      ",
            "question6": "When does STARdrop end?",
            "answer6": "\n        <p>Either on October 31 2019 or when all 10,000 STAR have been rewarded.</p>\n      ",
            "question7": "How can I track STAR rewards?",
            "answer7": "\n        <p>At the end of the campaign, we’ll publish the results for your reference. In the meantime, you can ask for help from our admins on <a href=\"https://t.me/constantcommunity\" class=\"underline bold\" target=\"_blank\">the STARdrop Telegram group</a>.</p>\n      "

            "1": {
                "question": "What is a masternode?",
                "answer": "A masternode is a member of a blockchain network that stores an entire copy of the blockchain on their computer at all times. They’re vital to maintaining and securing a blockchain network. To qualify as a masternode, you must first stake a large amount of a blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, which incentivizes the right behavior and discourages fraud. In return for helping maintain the network, masternodes receive a cryptocurrency reward."
            },
            "2": {
                "question": "What is a masternode pool?",
                "answer": "Rather than one person staking the minimum amount to become a masternode, a masternode pool crowdsources the cryptocurrency from multiple people on the network. This makes it easier to become a masternode for people without the minimum stake, and distributes the rewards among a greater number of people. As a masternode pool further decentralizes a network, it could also be argued it is more secure and democratic."
            },
            "3": {
                "question": "Will the staking rewards ever change?",
                "answer": "The interest you earn for staking in the masternode pool depends on the blockchain. It’ll be fixed for the beginning of your staking term, but might change during your term or the next time you stake. We’ll make it clear just how much you’ll earn through our masternode pool before you send your cryptocurrency."
            },
            "4": {
                "question": "Which cryptocurrencies do you support?",
                "answer": "Our first masternode pool will be for TomoChain. You’ll be able to stake TOMO for a reward of {reward}%. We’ll add other masternode pools in time. "
            },
            "5": {
                "question": "Where is my cryptocurrency stored?",
                "answer": "Like all masternodes, your cryptocurrency is stored in a smart contract escrow on the blockchain. Constant doesn’t take custody of your cryptocurrency. You can verify your stake at any time using your cryptocurrency’s blockchain explorer."
            },
            "6": {
                "question": "Can I withdraw my stake at anytime?",
                "answer": "Yes, you can withdraw your stake and earned interest at any time. However, to avoid network disruption, withdrawing from a masternode is not instant. Actual withdrawal times vary by blockchain. For TOMO, for example, withdrawals will take two days. As we add more cryptocurrencies to the masternode pool we’ll advise withdrawal times for each one."
            },
            "7": {
                "question": "How is interest paid?",
                "answer": "Interest is paid directly into your Constant account every 30 minutes. You’ll receive interest in the same cryptocurrency as the one you stake. For example, if you’re staking TOMO, you’ll earn TOMO interest. This is common across multiple blockchains."
            },
            "8": {
                "question": "Can I stake using loan collateral?",
                "answer": "Yes. If you’re borrowing against your collateral through our platform, you can offset the staking rewards against the cost of the loan. Exactly how much you can offset depends on your collateral, the staking rewards, and the duration of your staking and borrowing term. We’ll determine this mathematically and give you a revised rate before you begin staking."

I was very skeptical at first because it seemed too good to be true but in reality it is that great! Ultimately there is no fee to transfer money in or out, and it allows you to invest any amount of money for any rate that you would wish. Normally if I invest any sum of money for around 10% interest it is then matched to a borrower and I am able to earn the interest. If you go too high on the rate you don t lose anything but you also will not be matched to make money on your investment. It also lets you choose for how long to invest. Let me know if you have questions and I would be happy to explain more. My recommendation would be to set up an account and deposit a small amount to test it for yourself to get the hang of it.</p>\n                ",

Since that time I have tried to figure out how to best maximize my investment returns through various crypto platforms and after trying many of the platforms I have settled on two and Constant is one of those. As a lender looking to make a return on investment I could not be more pleased with what Constant does and how they do it. I feel that my capital is well taken care of, the platform allows me to earn outsized returns on “idle” cash that would either be tied up in a low interest bearing account at a bank or exposed to volatility in the stock market or locked up in an illiquid investment for years. Earning a consistent 10% return annual is not easy folks and as far as I can tell, Constant may be one of the only ways of doing that with a minimum amount of risk and relatively high liquidity. Like any investment in crypto, one has to always be mindful of what happens in a really rough bear market and there are no guarantees in life but I think Constant has built a truly standout platform that is well worth considering if you have capital available to invest into the crypto space.",
